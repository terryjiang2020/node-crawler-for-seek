We know that the success of the business depends on the people who keep it moving, which is why we are looking for exceptional talent to join our international payments revolution.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing simplicity, transparency & scale to cross-border payments - a $120 trillion market.\n**About the role.**\nOur software engineers are responsible for implementing an industry-leading API that has already processed over $50 billion of cross-border transactions for over 5 million end users, and is available to our clients 24\/7. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not stopping there, and our engineers are at the forefront of taking us forward to meet the demands of even greater scale.\nFrom our monolithic datacenter beginnings we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes and Jenkins-X as we further embrace a microservices architecture.\nAs a software engineer you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play a key role within your team; delivering new functionalities to the services your team provides, and taking responsibility for your services and the technology within them. Teams are aligned to services and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have:\n* clear ownership of your domain\n* a clean modern codebase\n* an independent path to production\n* strong platform and product support\n* the ability to make real changes with real business value.\nOur microservices architecture enables us to explore new languages and technologies in parallel with our existing system.\nThe core of our system has been built using Ruby, leveraging backing services like RabbitMQ, Redis, and MySQL\/Aurora, but we are keen to bring in engineers with more diverse backgrounds, and help us take Currencycloud to the next level of scale.\nWe are interested in Ruby developers, or people from any modern object oriented programming language that are willing to learn and code in Ruby.\nAs part of our TRUST team you will be building state of the art compliance systems that make our clients safe and ensure adherence to FCA standards across our business.\n**The Details**\nDay-to-day you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work with a variety of tools, technologies, capabilities and processes. * Highly-scalable, highly-available, cloud-native applications are key to our next phase of growth, are written to 12-factor principles and fit into our microservices architecture. * Cloud-related tools and services support these applications, such as Docker, Kubernetes, ElasticSearch, log management systems, and Datadog APM, to name but a few. * API specifications, conforming to the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard, provide a clean boundary both externally between our customers and our product, and internally between our microservices. * Object-oriented programming forms the bulk of our codebase, currently in Ruby and more recently in Java. We also have specialist applications written in a functional style using Scala and Elixir.\n* TRUST team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tech stack includes RoR applications with RabbitMQ as a queue service, MySQL as an underlying database engine, and Elasticsearch as a search engine and aggregation tool. Our frontends are written in Vue.JS. All of that running on Kubernetes clusters. SQL, and large SQL databases, provide the persistence layer for our applications. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be working with (and know the limitations of using) such large datastores. * Infrastructure automation is primarily owned by the infrastructure team, but you will be a consumer of their work, familiarity with AWS, Terraform and Docker is beneficial. * Testing approaches, including TDD, BDD and Contract Testing, all form an important part of our approach to quality assurance; ensuring that the code that we write forms products that are fit for use. We currently use RSpec and Cucumber. * Agile development, with teams broadly aligned with the Spotify - Squads & Tribes - model, helps us deliver incremental improvements to our products in an iterative manner. Advocating this model, and joining us on a journey of continuous improvement, is a key attribute of senior members of our teams.\n* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines allow us to \u00e2\u0080\u009cautomate all the things\u00e2\u0080\u009d, providing repeatable builds and consistent deployments.\n* GitHub, and the GitHub PR review process, forms a core part of our developer workflow, and peer reviews help share knowledge and improve quality. Teamwork, and cross-team collaboration, is fundamental to the delivery of our applications. Whilst each application has an independent path to production, there will always be some activities and initiatives that span multiple teams and require cross-team collaboration. Within your team you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, including Product Owners and QA, as part of your product development.\nNone of these on their own are a must-have to apply for the role, but it would be useful to share with us any knowledge or experience that you have in these areas.\n**Anything extra to add?**\nAlong with a no dress code policy & flexible working arrangements we also provide all of our employees with a prepaid debit card each month to spend on Wellness, or a contribution to a gym membership.\nWe offer a comprehensive range of employee benefits which include 25 days paid leave, 5% pension, BUPA health insurance, life insurance, long term sickness protection, a day off for your birthday and socials every Friday.\nWe are a Remote First Company, post-pandemic we plan on still using our offices but are totally flexible on how often.\n**About Currencycloud**\nCurrencycloud is a global payments platform built on smart technology that takes the complexity out of moving money. Developers use our API building blocks to build customised payment solutions. Whether you want to embed our payments infrastructure into your products or services, or build on top of it, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fit into your business in a way that works for you.\nWe take care of all the intricacies and regulatory hurdles involved with cross-border payments, giving you the tools to globalise your business.\nOur cloud-based platform removes that complexity from international transactions, giving you clarity and control over your business so you can focus on the things that matter: your customers. With enterprise-class solutions for clients and partners such as Visa and Starling Bank, Currencycloud understands your needs and can help with market-leading products.","location":"Europe","original":true,"url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/remote-jobs\/102271-remote-senior-ruby-developer-currencycloud","apply_url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/l\/102271"},{"slug":"102267-remote-full-stack-developer-fokus-javascript-iubh-internationale-hochschule","id":"102267","epoch":"1613659078","date":"2021-02-18T14:37:58+00:00","company":"IUBH Internationale Hochschule","company_logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/efcfb528495c96f63241719f17eef76f1614153641.png","position":"Full Stack Developer Fokus JavaScript","tags":["full stack","dev","javascript","digital nomad"],"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/efcfb528495c96f63241719f17eef76f1614153641.png","description":"T&auml;tigkeitsbeschreibung<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><p>Wachse mit uns - Starte Deine Karriere bei der IUBH!<\/p><br \/><br \/><p>Du bist IT-Experte und auf der Suche nach einer neuen beruflichen Herausforderung?

We wanted faster, simpler ways to ask questions about data, and wanted to strip away the colder feel of most Enterprise software. Folks seemed to agree, and now Metabase is used daily by tens of thousands of companies to give people in all sorts of roles access to insights they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have otherwise had. None of this could happen without our user interface and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you come in. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone with strong product sensibilities, extraordinarily good frontend skills, and solid software engineering fundamentals to join our team to advance the state of the art in our product and our industry.\n\n*Why choose Metabase*\n- The problems we face are genuinely interesting and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trivial. Data influences so much of our world but isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that easy to interact with or understand. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make tools that people rely on for their real jobs.\n- You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to work in open source and get feedback directly from users and customers out in the open.\n- The company is growing and so is the business. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding new remote team members from around the world and improving our processes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an exciting time and you can really have an impact on how things work here.\n- We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to design our work environment to fit into real life. Work is only one part of who you are, so we emphasize reasonable workdays and prefer planning and avoiding panic. People at Metabase have families, dogs, plants, and lives outside of work and we try to support that however we can.\\\n\n*What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for*:\n- You **care about crafting delightful user experiences**. You like to write code to enable people to do something and you understand that details and things like copy matter. If your focus is only on code this might not be the best role for you.\n- Prior **experience shipping non-trivial apps using React + Redux (or equivalent)**. Our front end is written in React (surprise!), so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need really strong React and JavaScript knowledge to build fast and thoughtful user interfaces.\n- You have experience **writing tests, giving good feedback on other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s code**, and writing proposals for more complicated problems that are thoughtful and clear. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a remote company (even outside of pandemics) **communication and clarity are really important**.\n- Due to the nature of what we work on, computer science-y problems come up frequently. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not picky about a specific degree or accolade, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to **write fast and performant code** and deal with a fair bit of **data structure manipulation** regularly.\n- We like everyone to care about the nuts and bolts of how to make things look good, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to use our style guide and if necessary write or update our CSS, **so comfort in CSS and familiarity with things like design systems and component libraries is a necessity**.\n- You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on a large and complex JavaScript project. Metabase is a big product and code base so the **ability to adapt existing code and integrate new code into established systems** is important and you should feel comfortable digging in.\n\n*Not essential, but nice to have*:\n- Knowledge and prior experience with data visualization (especially if it has involved dc.js and d3.js).\n- Previous contributions to open source (not a requirement, but a huge plus).\n- Either pre-existing knowledge or interest in learning some Clojure, the language much of the backend of our application is written in.\n\n*The types of problems you'd get to work on*:\n- Lightning fast interaction with data. Think things like letting people see all the orders that came in from a specific region by clicking directly on a custom map of their sales regions and then letting them filter that list visually by directly interacting with the data table - and all of this happening in a responsive and delightful way.\n- Augmenting visualizations. To allow for people to further institutional knowledge, build the feature to allow annotations directly on specific data points in a line chart, and then determine how to expose those when it makes sense across dashboards and the entire app.\n- Wayfinding. We want to make sure people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been done, so build new ways to surface important metrics or segments to the right users across Metabase.\n- Embedded analytics. We have customers who deliver analytics to their own users via our embed product. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get to tackle the problem of making sure those can match their own products visually and enable easier integration of the embeds into their own code.","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/remote-jobs\/102141-remote-frontend-software-engineer-metabase","apply_url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/l\/102141"},{"slug":"102140-remote-site-reliability-engineer-doximity","id":"102140","epoch":"1613175013","date":"2021-02-13T00:10:13+00:00","company":"Doximity","company_logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/728511e22a540f633300439359585f881613175013.png","position":"Site Reliability Engineer","tags":["ruby","rails","terraform","chef","unix","aws","health tech","medical","sys admin","engineer","admin","ruby"],"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/728511e22a540f633300439359585f881613175013.png","description":"Doximity is transforming the healthcare industry.

Expect to roll up your sleeves and be in the weeds, doing the work.\n\n# \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 ABOUT PIXELLU\nAt Pixellu, we know professional photographers are frustrated with all of the tedious work required to run a successful photography business. Many get so overwhelmed, they end up quitting on their dream of having a photography career. That is why we create easy-to-use, time-saving software that simplify photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives, so that they can spend less time in front of the computer and get back to doing what they love.\n\nPixellu was co-founded in 2010 by two wedding photographers. Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well.\n\nToday, we are a team of 30 team members spread across 10 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries.\n\nLearn more about us and why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love working at Pixellu here:  https:\/\/vimeo.com\/405889874 \n\n# \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e YOUR ROLE\nPixellu currently has three products - SmartAlbums, SmartSlides, and Galleries.

We are a **developer-first company**, committed to building around open protocols and delivering the best experience possible for data consumers and publishers.\n\nSplitgraph is a **seed-stage, venture-funded startup hiring its initial team**. The two co-founders are looking to grow the team to five or six people. This is an opportunity to make a big impact on an agile team while working closely with the\nfounders.\n\nSplitgraph is a **remote-first organization**. The founders are based in the UK, and the company is incorporated in both USA and UK. Candidates are welcome to apply from any geography. We want to work with the most talented, thoughtful and productive engineers in the world.\n# Open Positions\n**Data Engineers welcome!** The job titles have \"Software Engineer\" in them, but at Splitgraph there's a lot of overlap \nbetween data and software engineering. We welcome candidates from all engineering backgrounds.\n\n[Senior Software Engineer - Backend (mainly Python)](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/splitgraph\/Senior-Software-Engineer-Backend-2a2f9e278ba347069bf2566950857250)\n\n[Senior Software Engineer - Frontend (mainly TypeScript)](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/splitgraph\/Senior-Software-Engineer-Frontend-6342cd76b0df483a9fd2ab6818070456)\n\n\u00e2\u0086\u0092 [**Apply to Job**](https:\/\/4o99daw6ffu.typeform.com\/to\/ePkNQiDp) \u00e2\u0086\u0090 (same form for both positions)\n\n# What is Splitgraph?\n## **Open Source Toolkit**\n\n[Our open-source product, sgr,](https:\/\/www.github.com\/splitgraph\/splitgraph) is a tool for building, versioning and querying reproducible datasets. It's inspired by Docker and Git, so it feels familiar. And it's powered by PostgreSQL, so it works seamlessly with existing tools in the Postgres ecosystem. Use Splitgraph to package your data into self-contained\ndata images that you can share with other Splitgraph instances.\n\n## **Splitgraph Cloud**\n\nSplitgraph Cloud is a platform for data cataloging, integration and governance. The user can upload data, connect live databases, or \"push\" versioned snapshots to it. We give them a unified SQL interface to query that data, a catalog to discover and share it, and tools to build\/push\/pull it.\n\n# Learn More About Us\n\n- Listen to our interview on the [Software Engineering Daily podcast](https:\/\/softwareengineeringdaily.com\/2020\/11\/06\/splitgraph-data-catalog-and-proxy-with-miles-richardson\/)\n\n- Watch our co-founder Artjoms present [Splitgraph at the Bay Area ClickHouse meetup](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=44CDs7hJTho)\n\n- Read our HN\/Reddit posts ([one](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=24233948) [two](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=23769420) [three](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=23627066) [four](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/datasets\/comments\/icty0r\/we_made_40k_open_government_datasets_queryable\/))\n\n- [Read our blog](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com\/blog)\n\n- Read the slides from our early (2018) presentations: [\"Docker for Data\"](https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/splitgraph\/splitgraph-docker-for-data-119112722), [AHL Meetup](https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/splitgraph\/splitgraph-ahl-talk)\n\n- [Follow us on Twitter](https:\/\/ww.twitter.com\/splitgraph)\n\n- [Find us on GitHub](https:\/\/www.github.com\/splitgraph)\n\n- [Chat with us in our community Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/eFEFRKm)\n\n- Explore the [public data catalog](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com\/explore) where we index 40k+ datasets\n\n# How We Work: What's our stack look like?\n\nWe prioritize developer experience and productivity. We resent repetition and inefficiency, and we never hesitate to automate the things that cause us friction. Here's a sampling of the languages and tools we work with:\n\n- **[Python](https:\/\/www.python.org\/) for the backend.** Our [core open source](https:\/\/www.github.com\/splitgraph\/splitgraph) tech is written in Python (with [a bit of C](https:\/\/github.com\/splitgraph\/Multicorn) to make it more interesting), as well as most of our backend code. The Python code powers everything from authentication routines to database migrations. We use the latest version and tools like [pytest](https:\/\/docs.pytest.org\/en\/stable\/), [mypy](https:\/\/github.com\/python\/mypy) and [Poetry](https:\/\/python-poetry.org\/) to help us write quality software.\n\n- **[TypeScript](https:\/\/www.typescriptlang.org\/) for the web stack.** We use TypeScript throughout our web stack. On the frontend we use [React](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/) with [next.js](https:\/\/nextjs.org\/). For data fetching we use [apollo-client](https:\/\/www.apollographql.com\/docs\/react\/) with fully-typed GraphQL queries auto-generated by [graphql-codegen](https:\/\/graphql-code-generator.com\/) based on the schema that [Postgraphile](https:\/\/www.graphile.org\/postgraphile) creates by introspecting the database.\n\n- [**PostgreSQL](https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/) for the database, because of course.** Splitgraph is a company built around Postgres, so of course we are going to use it for our own database. In fact, we actually have three databases. We have `auth-db` for storing sensitive data, `registry-db` which acts as a [Splitgraph peer](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com\/docs\/publishing-data\/push-data) so users can push Splitgraph images to it using [sgr](https:\/\/www.github.com\/splitgraph\/splitgraph), and `cloud-db` where we store the schemata that Postgraphile uses to autogenerate the GraphQL server.\n\n- [**PL\/pgSQL](https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/docs\/current\/plpgsql.html) and [PL\/Python](https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/docs\/current\/plpython.html) for stored procedures.** We define a lot of core business logic directly in the database as stored procedures, which are ultimately [exposed by Postgraphile as GraphQL endpoints](https:\/\/www.graphile.org\/postgraphile\/functions\/). We find this to be a surprisingly productive way of developing, as it eliminates the need for manually maintaining an API layer between data and code. It presents challenges for testing and maintainability, but we've built tools to help with database migrations and rollbacks, and an end-to-end testing framework that exercises the database routines.\n\n- [**PostgREST](https:\/\/postgrest.org\/en\/v7.0.0\/) for auto-generating a REST API for every repository.** We use this excellent library (written in [Haskell](https:\/\/www.haskell.org\/)) to expose an [OpenAPI](https:\/\/github.com\/OAI\/OpenAPI-Specification)-compatible REST API for every repository on Splitgraph ([example](http:\/\/splitgraph.com\/mildbyte\/complex_dataset\/latest\/-\/api-schema)).\n\n- **Lua ([luajit](https:\/\/luajit.org\/luajit.html) 5.x), C, and [embedded Python](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/extending\/embedding.html) for scripting [PgBouncer](https:\/\/www.pgbouncer.org\/).** Our main product, the \"data delivery network\", is a single SQL endpoint where users can query any data on Splitgraph. Really it's a layer of PgBouncer instances orchestrating temporary Postgres databases and proxying queries to them, where we load and cache the data necessary to respond to a query. We've added scripting capabilities to enable things like query rewriting, column masking, authentication, ACL, orchestration, firewalling, etc.\n\n- **[Docker](https:\/\/www.docker.com\/) for packaging services.** Our CI pipeline builds every commit into about a dozen different Docker images, one for each of our services. A production instance of Splitgraph can be running over 60 different containers (including replicas).\n\n- **[Makefile](https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/make\/manual\/make.html) and** [docker-compose](https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/compose\/) **for development.** We use [a highly optimized Makefile](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com\/blog\/makefile) and `docker-compose` so that developers can easily spin-up a stack that mimics production in every way, while keeping it easy to hot reload, run tests, or add new services or configuration.\n\n- **[Nomad](https:\/\/www.nomadproject.io\/) for deployment and [Terraform](https:\/\/www.terraform.io\/) for provisioning.** We use Nomad to manage deployments and background tasks. Along with Terraform, we're able to spin up a Splitgraph cluster on AWS, GCP, Scaleway or Azure in just a few minutes.\n\n- **[Airflow](https:\/\/airflow.apache.org\/) for job orchestration.** We use it to run and monitor jobs that maintain our catalog of [40,000 public datasets](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com\/blog\/40k-sql-datasets), or ingest other public data into Splitgraph.\n\n- **[Grafana](https:\/\/grafana.com\/), [Prometheus](https:\/\/prometheus.io\/), [ElasticSearch](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/), and [Kibana](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/kibana) for monitoring and metrics.** We believe it's important to self-host fundamental infrastructure like our monitoring stack. We use this to keep tabs on important metrics and the health of all Splitgraph deployments.\n\n- **[Mattermost](https:\/\/mattermost.com\/) for company chat.** We think it's absolutely bonkers to pay a company like Slack to hold your company communication hostage. That's why we self-host an instance of Mattermost for our internal chat. And of course, we can deploy it and update it with Terraform.\n\n- **[Matomo](https:\/\/matomo.org\/) for web analytics.** We take privacy seriously, and we try to avoid including any third party scripts on our web pages (currently we include zero). We self-host our analytics because we don't want to share our user data with third parties.\n\n- **[Metabase](https:\/\/www.metabase.com\/) and [Splitgraph](https:\/\/www.splitgraph.com) for BI and [dogfooding](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eating_your_own_dog_food)**. We use Metabase as a frontend to a Splitgraph instance that connects to Postgres (our internal databases), MySQL (Matomo's database), and ElasticSearch (where we store logs and DDN analytics). We use this as a chance to dogfood our software and produce fancy charts.\n\n- **The occasional best-of-breed SaaS services** **for organization.** As a privacy-conscious, independent-minded company, we try to avoid SaaS services as much as we can. But we still find ourselves unable to resist some of the better products out there. For organization we use tools like [Zoom](https:\/\/www.zoom.us) for video calls, [Miro](https:\/\/miro.com\/) for brainstorming, [Notion](https:\/\/www.notion.so) for documentation (you're on it!), [Airtable for workflow management](https:\/\/airtable.com\/), [PivotalTracker](https:\/\/www.pivotaltracker.com\/) for ticketing, and [GitLab for dev-ops and CI](https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/).\n\n- **Other fun technologies** including [HAProxy](http:\/\/www.haproxy.org\/), [OpenResty](https:\/\/openresty.org\/en\/), [Varnish](https:\/\/varnish-cache.org\/), and bash. We don't touch them much because they do their job well and rarely break.\n\n# Life at Splitgraph\n**We are a young company building the initial team.** As an early contributor, you'll have a chance to shape our initial mission, growth and company values.\n\n**We think that remote work is the future**, and that's why we're building a remote-first organization. We chat on [Mattermost](https:\/\/mattermost.com\/) and have video calls on Zoom. We brainstorm with [Miro](https:\/\/miro.com\/) and organize with [Notion](https:\/\/www.notion.so).\n\n**We try not to take ourselves too seriously**, but we are goal-oriented with an ambitious mission.\n\n**We believe that as a small company, we can out-compete incumbents** by thinking from first principles about how organizations interact with data. We are very competitive.\n\n# Benefits\n- Fully remote\n\n- Flexible working hours\n\n- Generous compensation and equity package\n\n- Opportunity to make high-impact contributions to an agile team\n\n# How to Apply?

Our purpose is to improve supply chains through better operations management. We're building the brain for every warehouse in the world (and eventually on Mars) to help leaders make faster and better decisions, and we hope you can join us!<\/p><br \/><p>CognitOps was founded by a team of lifelong supply chain technology builders. We realized that today's supply chains are unsustainable and wasteful for businesses, jobs, and the environment. And with the support of our family, friends, pets, and investors, we chose to take this challenge head-on bravely. Backed by some of the best VCs in the industry, we began our pursuit of unleashing ingenuity to give rise to resilient businesses.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><p><strong>Why CognitOps?<\/strong><\/p><br \/><p>We tackle cool, challenging problems. For example, we help warehouses supply hospitals with PPE and critical medical equipment more efficiently. We help e-commerce businesses ship orders on time. We tackle these challenging problems using modern technologies like machine learning, queue-based simulation, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Scala. Our team has decades of startup experience working with big data and building scalable, fault-tolerant, secure software and decades of experience working with warehouses and empathetically understanding the needs they have. We're still a small early-stage company. So you'll have an opportunity to come in, make a huge impact, and be a leader as the company grows. But at the same time, we have significant early customer traction and are already on an accelerated growth path. We believe in having a fun, loose work environment while also fostering a culture grounded in grit, accountability, innovation, collaboration, and bravery.<\/p><br \/><p><strong>The Challenge<\/strong><\/p><br \/><p>Supply chains are struggling to evolve. For every 1 billion dollars of e-commerce growth, North America builds 1 million more square feet of warehousing. Yet, warehouses are fraught with waste. Why? Because operations managers and leaders have never had the tools to manage their facilities correctly. It&rsquo;s mind-boggling to think that the industry continues to invest in robots and point solutions that only perpetuate this broken model. This challenge is compounded by people understandably not wanting to work in these environments. We can fix this together. We can build in the cloud, apply machine learning, build unique products and datasets, and be nonconformists always challenging the status quo together.<\/p><br \/><p>&nbsp;<strong>What You Bring<\/strong><\/p><br \/><p>&nbsp;Experience in successfully&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><ul><br \/><li>Building highly available, secure, redundant, and scalable distributed systems;<\/li><br \/><li>Writing code that is performant, maintainable, clear, and concise;<\/li><br \/><li>Working closely with product management and data science while building and scaling back-end services;<\/li><br \/><li>Collaborating with product and design to support an optimal user experience;<\/li><br \/><li>Participating in code reviews to maintain and improve quality;<\/li><br \/><li>Building new features with a focus on extensibility and quality; and,<\/li><br \/><li>Optimizing and refactoring existing code when needed<\/li><br \/><\/ul><br \/><p>&nbsp;The following creds get us interested&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><ul><br \/><li>5+ years of experience as a Software Engineer in a JVM language, with increasingly impactful accomplishments<\/li><br \/><li>A strong desire to learn and program in Scala, demonstrable curiosity with Scala meetups or personal training is a plus<\/li><br \/><li>Experience with cloud computing (Google Cloud Platform, AWS, etc.) desirable<\/li><br \/><li>Solid understanding of SQL and relational database modeling concepts and experience with RDBMS such as PosgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server<\/li><br \/><li>Experience in highly scalable service-oriented architectures<\/li><br \/><li>Ability to work both independently on ambiguous problems and in highly collaborative team environments<\/li><br \/><li>Deep curiosity to find out why we have a shrine to a burned-up microwave<\/li><br \/><\/ul><br \/><p>&nbsp;The following creds get us excited&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><ul><br \/><li>You love to build new code<\/li><br \/><li>You're not happy spending all day maintaining existing code<\/li><br \/><li>You care about what you do<\/li><br \/><li>You care about what we do<\/li><br \/><li>You live our values<\/li><br \/><\/ul><br \/><p>We want to see your problem-solving and analytical skills.

We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success. We are currently seeking a talented, passionate, enthusiastic Customer Support Champion to join our team. As a business, our DNA and core are about excellence in customer experience plus we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a big period of growth for the business, so we see this role as one of the most integral ones on our team.\nThe role has two critical and interrelated, but distinct responsibilities. You need to be passionate, experienced, and talented at both.\n**Customer Care:\n**\nWe call this role a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccustomer champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a reason-your role is to be the customer advocate and champion for our business. Good customer service seeks to understand a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation and help them resolve that situation at the first point of contact. Great customer service seeks to resolve that customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need and translate that need back to the business to ensure that we improve-sometimes in tiny ways-and avoid any customer having a similar confusion moving forward. Incredible customer service does not just that but seeks to listen to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not being said, read between the lines and take that back to make the experience better-for that customer and everyone after that one. We believe our customers deserve incredible customer care. So, if you do too, and you love to help people, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand the idea of anyone ever being confused, or have anything other than a surprisingly delightful experience working with us, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love for you to apply.\n**Sales:\n**\nIn the same way that we care deeply about customer experience, we also understand that in order to win that business, we need to earn the trust of prospective customers. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not easy (nor should it be!). We know that when someone starts the process of engaging a tax preparer, they may feel anxious, they may feel frustrated, and they may dread the process. Taxes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at the top of their list, and they need us to make it easy for them, but also make them feel confident that we are in control of their tax needs. The right salesperson doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just answer a question but helps to really explain and articulate what makes Greenback special and why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a great fit compared to other alternatives. The right salesperson can speak intelligently about taxes, about how we work, about the strength of our accountant team, and do so in a genuine, non-pushy way. Timeliness, appropriate feedback, good knowledge of the industry as well as our internal process are all critical to the role.\nLast but certainly not least we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great fit for our company culture. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a small, tight-knit team-all of us working remotely from home offices. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re growing fast (check us out on the INC 5000 list-woohoo!). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obsessive about customer experience, believe that planning is the key to success, and like to work hard and make things happen-but also live our lives outside of the (home) office too! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone who is confident, reliable, an excellent communicator loves working in a fast-paced team, and is able to get things done with minimal supervision (we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like looking over your shoulder and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like that either).\n## Key Skills Needed:\n- Excellent communication skills (does that go without saying?). You will mostly be speaking with people via email (80%), with some phone calls (20%). You need to be able to read between the lines and craft messaging that is warm, friendly, professional and really meets the need of the specific demands of that email interaction.\n- The ability to convert warm leads at a high volume by setting proper expectations, providing thoughtful responses, and clearly outlining the next steps.\n- Ability to identify opportunities to add value by monitoring industry changes, trends, and customer needs.\n- Use analytics to manage and measure your success, know where to put additional effort, and prioritize. That means you need to be someone who can manage targets, metrics, and can analyze these metrics, understand what they mean, and make good decisions as a result.\n- Excellence in execution: Attention to detail and ability to keep organized\/juggle multiple things at once. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a seasonal business, so there are times when our inboxes are on fire! This is part of the role and being organized, handling stress well, and being able to juggle high-demand situations comes with the territory.\n- We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect you to be an accountant, but you will need to learn and become a subject matter expert on US expat taxes.\nBonus: current or former expat, or someone who appreciates or gets excited about the expat life.\n- Time zone: we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone who is in a fixed time zone. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not looking for long term travelers\/people who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the same time zone most of the year.\n## What We Offer:\n- The opportunity for you to work with highly talented, communicative, make-it-happen people who also love adventure.\n- We have an excellent benefits package that includes a 401k plan (with a 6% company match).\n- Medical, vision, and dental coverage as well as a short-term disability!\n- Annual team trip (last year: San Diego, 2019: Playa del Carmen, Mexico).","location":"United States","original":true,"url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/remote-jobs\/101920-remote-customer-support-champion-greenback-expat-tax-services","apply_url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/l\/101920"},{"slug":"101928-remote-net-developers-with-set-works-least-one-year-of-experience","id":"101928","epoch":"1612474063","date":"2021-02-04T21:27:43+00:00","company":"least one year of experience","company_logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/39040974021cf9760f2b50947aaa0c131614153703.png","position":".NET Developers With SET Works","tags":[],"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/39040974021cf9760f2b50947aaa0c131614153703.png","description":"<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a&nbsp;mid and senior developer for our small but growing team.

We're a small development team of eight (six men, two women), in a company of 24, and we typically only hire twice a year.\nEvery person on the dev team has an outsized impact on the product\u00e2\u0080\u0094each feature is often the product of just one or two developers working together with a designer\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you can be one of them.\nOne week you might be finishing off the redesign of a feature for our creators, the next you might be optimizing a SQL query to keep our storefronts running smoothly. We plan about three months in advance, but we pivot rapidly so you shouldn't expect those plans to be set in stone.\nEvery developer on the team works on:\n- Shipping new features to help our creators' businesses thrive\n- Polishing our existing features to improve our users' experience\n- Writing tests and fixing bugs in our code\n- Communicating their progress in regular Basecamp updates\n- Reviewing pull requests from other team members\n- Helping out our support team with customer issues during a regular week-long rotation\n- Paying down technical debt to keeping the codebase shiny\n- Deploying code to production, verifying it works as you expected, and taking a 24-hour on-call shift for when the worst happens (rarely! \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009e)\nYou can expect to be working with:\n- Ruby on Rails 6.1\n- PostgreSQL\n- Stimulus, StimulusReflex, CableReady, and React (in that order of most to least often)\n- Webpacker, Bootstrap, ViewComponent, ES6, and yarn to manage our UI code.\n- Sidekiq for background processing, including fun features like periodic jobs and batches\n- Heroku for everything\n- We also maintain integrations with many third-party APIs (PayPal, Stripe, Zapier and Drip, just to name a few)\n- A codebase with 1:1.3 code-to-test ratio, with almost 10K examples, that runs on our CI system in four minutes\nYou probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know all these technologies inside out, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay! This is not a laundry list of requirements.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re curious, you can read about [Podia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering culture](https:\/\/jamie.ideasasylum.com\/2020\/07\/17\/podia-engineering-culture\/) and [our current toolbox](https:\/\/jamie.ideasasylum.com\/2021\/01\/01\/tools-of-podia-2020-edition\/) on our CTO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blog.\n## Does this sound like you?\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the developer we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll already be familiar and confident with Rails, with two to three years experience, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you level-up those skills, learn new technologies like StimulusReflex and ViewComponent, and practice them on a complex web application with plenty of new challenges.\nYou will be based in [UTC](https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/worldclock\/timezone\/utc) to [UTC+8](https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/worldclock\/timezone\/utc8) timezones to ensure a reasonable overlap with our current product team in Ireland, the US, Canada, and South America.\n\"Full-stack\" is an over-used term so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put it this way: Rails is our home turf and you'll feel comfortable and productive writing Ruby, building new feature in Rails, writing views in ERB, and using ActiveRecord. In addition, you'll probably have a few special areas of expertise or interest. Perhaps you enjoy playing with AWS infrastructure and using Terraform; perhaps you enjoy refactoring and using design patterns to make cleaner software; or you have a flair for user experience design and an eye for detail.\nHere's some skill gaps we have on the team which we'd like to fill in the short-term:\n- Modern JavaScript knowledge. Do you enjoy tweaking Webpack configuration, reducing JavaScript dependencies, and optimizing build pipelines? We don't write much JavaScript but, when we do, we want it to be modern and efficient.\n- CSS expert. Do you see a design and instantly understand which CSS attributes are required? Can you tweak Bootstrap variables to match our brand? Do you make designers happy with your pixel-perfect implementations?\n- Experience scaling Rails. Have you been through the easy stages of scaling a Rails app, and earned some hard-fought wins against the next few boss levels? When SELECT count(*) FROM customers; is too slow, you have several tried-and-tested strategies for speeding it up.\nThese are not definitive so don't exclude yourself if you don't fit one of these descriptions. We have many more needs and we'll find roles for any exceptional candidate.\n**Some other things you should be comfortable with:**\n- Communicating your progress clearly in Slack or Basecamp and highlighting blockers and risks early. Communication is a core competency \u00e2\u009c\u008d\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n- Collaborate with other team members either synchronously during an online pairing session (you can initially expect to be pairing for at least half your time) or asynchronously via pull requests \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0090\n- Working individually on solo projects without disappearing down a rabbit hole for days \u00f0\u009f\u0095\u00b3\n- Learning quickly, and developing confidently\u00e2\u0080\u0094because nothing is \u00e2\u0080\u009csomeone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job\u00e2\u0080\u009d and there's always something new to learn \u00f0\u009f\u00a6\u009d\n- Lending a hand to your teammates (and customers) when the need arises. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tightly knit and supporting each other is a huge priority \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009d\n- Multiple competing (and sometimes shifting) priorities \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085\n- Staying calm under pressure.

It has become notable for its profane nature, aggressive trading strategies, and role in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze.\n\nThe subreddit, describing itself through the tagline \"Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal\",[2] is known for its aggressive trading strategies, which primarily revolve around highly speculative, leveraged options trading. Members of the subreddit are often young retail traders and investors who ignore fundamental investment practices and risk management techniques, so their activity is considered gambling. The growing popularity of no-commission brokers and mobile online trading has potentially contributed to the growth of such trading trends. Members of the communities often see high-risk day trading as an opportunity to quickly improve their financial conditions and obtain additional income. Some of the members tend to use borrowed capital, like student loans, to bet on certain \"meme stocks\" that show popularity within the community.[1][3][4][5][6]\n\nThe subreddit is also known for its profane and juvenile nature, with members often referring to themselves as \"autists\" and \"degenerates.\"[5][7]\n\n# History: The GameStop Short Squeeze\nOn January 22, 2021, users of r\/WallStreetBets initiated a short squeeze on GameStop, pushing their stock prices up significantly. This occurred shortly after a comment from Citron Research predicting the value of the stock would decrease.[8] The stock price increased more than 600% by January 26, and its high volatility caused trading to be halted multiple times.[9][10]\n\nOn January 24, a moderator of r\/WallStreetBets wrote a post stating: \"There is NO organized effort by those [of] us who moderate this community to promote, advise or recommend any stock. It is against our policy to do so and we feel it is crucial to allow members to be able to share their ideas amongst each other with autonomy.\"[11]\n\nAfter the GameStop stock closed up 92.7% on Tuesday, January 26, business magnate Elon Musk tweeted out a link to the r\/WallStreetBets subreddit.[12]\n\nOn January 27, r\/WallStreetBets users triggered a short squeeze on AMC, a company in a similar position to GameStop.[13]\n\nOn January 27, the official WallStreetBets Discord server was banned for \"hateful and discriminatory content\". Discord denied that the ban was related to the ongoing GameStop short squeeze.[14] In an official statement posted to the r\/WallStreetBets subreddit, moderators claimed that their efforts to automatically delete content that violated rules had been overwhelmed by the sheer influx of users and the use of obscure Unicode characters, and criticized Discord for not providing the tools needed to take action to curtail hate speech on the server.[15] This was shortly followed by the subreddit being switched to private by the moderators at around 7:00 p.m. EST, before being made public again around an hour later.[16] Within one week of the GameStop short squeeze, the subreddit had gained over 2.4 million new subscribers, whereas it took 9 years to reach 2.2 million.[17] As of January 28, the WallStreetBets Discord server is online.\n\n# Effect on the Robinhood Trading Platform\nMany members of the subreddit use the popular mobile app Robinhood to trade stocks and options. Some members have been responsible for significant feature removals and bug fixes after identifying and publishing methods of exploit.[18]\n\n# Robinhood Restricts Trading\nOn January 28, 2021, in response to r\/wallstreetbets's involvement in the GameStop short squeeze, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Webull restricted the trade of heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia, and Koss Corporation on their platforms.[23]\n\nOn January 28, 2021, in response to r\/wallstreetbets's involvement in the GameStop short squeeze, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Webull restricted the trade of heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia, and Koss Corporation on their platforms.[23]\n\n# References\nDavidson, Jake (October 25, 2018). \"Meet the Bros Behind \/r\/WallStreetBets, Who Lose Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in a Day\u00e2\u0080\u0094And Brag About It\".

It means pouring your heart into ensuring something gets done.\n* Respectful - Being respectful means that customers and employees work well with you even in difficult situations. It's about being a good team player. It includes being fully and painfully honest about work related issues in a consistent way. It's recognizing that you are part of a team and sometimes you will win your point and sometimes you won't. It's about building a professional friendship.\n* Can-do Attitude - Can do attitude is about believing in yourself and your team to get the job done. There is a delicate balance between having optimism for the future and being realistic about your goals. A person with a can-do attitude is realistically optimistic and positive about what can and will be done.\n* Grow or Die - Grow or Die means to have a spirit dedicated to consistently getting better at your job. Finding ways, even small ways, of producing a higher quality or efficiency. Having a drive to learn more about your field from a variety of resources. Exhibiting the will to never give up on improving yourself.\n* Reliable - The heart of reliability means to deliver on your promises. These promises include being on time every day. It means consistently delivering on the goals and milestones set for you. It means having a system to not forget any, even small, aspects of your job.\n\n**Required Skills**\n* UI Design\n* React (Website)\n* Swift (iOS)\n* Kotlin (Android)\n* GraphQL\n\n**Preferred Skills**\n* MySQL\n* Golang\n\n**Location**\n* You must be located in an Eastern European time zone\n\n**Benefits**\n* Health Care Plan (ICHRA)\n* Retirement Plan (Simple IRA)\n* Life Insurance (Basic, Voluntary & AD&D)\n* Paid Time Off (Vacation & Holidays)\n* Short Term Disability\n* Training & Development\n* Career Advancement Opportunities","location":"Eastern Europe","original":true,"url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/remote-jobs\/101689-remote-software-developer-norhart","apply_url":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/l\/101689"},{"slug":"101714-remote-lead-backend-engineer-signavio","id":"101714","epoch":"1611845819","date":"2021-01-28T14:56:59+00:00","company":"Signavio","company_logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/3da2453452de01c4705055880da5d5e61614153728.png","position":"Lead Backend Engineer (Berlin, Germany)","tags":["exec","engineer","backend"],"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/3da2453452de01c4705055880da5d5e61614153728.png","description":"<p>Signavio is looking for a Lead Backend Engineer (Java and\/or Kotlin)&nbsp; to help us build the future of our Business Transformation Suite.
