At the current customer growth rate, they expect to have 50,000 customers using their product in the coming weeks.</p><p>\nWe are looking for a superstar who can cope with the significant high demands of this rapidly growing business and help them approach best practices and implement solutions fast to help scale their platform.</p><p>\nCoviu was first created within the Australian research organisation CSIRO as part of research into telehealth delivery platforms. Working closely with clinicians, they found that existing consumer video calling software and corporate video conferencing applications were not appropriate for healthcare services.

The local development environment is spun up using Docker images to allow you full control. They follow a continuous integration and continuous delivery approach with a vast automated test suite and an automated deployment pipeline into AWS. You&apos;ll be working across most of the Coviu platform components, including their WebRTC based video conferencing solution, third party integrations, and their internal and external applications.</p><p>\nCoviu&apos;s client facing web application is built with a particular focus on a top notch user experience. Built on the React and Mercury frameworks, they follow modern responsive design principles. Mobile apps are build using react-native.</p><p>\nYou&apos;ll also be helping to build Coviu&apos;s engineering culture by identifying and communicating best practices, and participating in code reviews.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>What we&apos;re looking for:</b></p><p>\nAs Coviu&apos;s stack is heavily based on Javascript technologies, you will have:</p><ul><li>\nExperience as a full stack engineer delivering production ready systems using modern Javascript</li><li>\nA deep understanding of software engineering fundamentals</li><li>\nProven debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>\nExcellent communication skills and the ability to contribute as part of a team</li><li>\nA love of clean, maintainable code</li><li>\nBe able to build simple, elegant solutions that strike the balance between perfection and shipping things quickly.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>They are looking for engineers who love to learn and are keen to get stuck in, while taking</p><p>\nresponsibility for delivering a quality product.</p><p>\n</p><p>This opportunity is an excellent opportunity for an outstanding Senior Developer/Lead developer to join one of Australia&apos;s leading telehealth platforms, and apply your skills to make a real difference.
