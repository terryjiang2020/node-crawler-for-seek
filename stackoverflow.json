It&#x2019;s a tech challenge. Everything we deal with is asynchronous. There can be milliseconds or weeks in between reactions or events. This comes with a set of technical challenges that go above and beyond the run of the mill app. There are multiple stakeholders, inputs, and third parties. As a team, we built a fully enterprise-ready solution in the course of a few months, one capable of scaling almost infinitely. Our architecture is unique and provides real flexibility for implementing new features.</p><p>Our people want to win and push themselves to become the best in their field. They combine a never-ending curiosity, a desire to make things happen, work openly and closely with colleagues across the business, and evolve to become comfortable with making their own decisions and taking responsibility for services that make up the entire system.</p><p>They put in the thought on complex issues, talk within the team about the tradeoffs of various solutions, welcome feedback, and implement quality directly into the code. This includes comfort with various abstractions and patterns, as well as creating the tests necessary to ensure that the code works properly. When there is technical debt created, they document it for later, or while building something new, refactor the services to make them better as they go.</p><p>If you think a great day starts with a challenge to solve, want to have a real impact in one of Europe&#x2019;s Fintech companies, and be part of a diverse team, then send us a CV and do include some information that&#x2019;s helpful to round out the bullet points in a CV. This could be a short blurb why you&#x2019;re interested, a link to code or projects you&#x2019;ve done in the past. Anything that helps us understand you.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll be working in tandem with Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Operations in order to shape the future of the platform we are building.

We work in 8-week cycles, focusing on directed work for 6-weeks, and &quot;sharpening the saw&quot; with undirected work for 2-weeks at the end of each cycle. We remove unnecessary obstacles so you can work directly with customers who are developers just like us. Our teams are software tradespeople who care about doing things right the first time. You will probably be surprised at how collaboratively we work both inside and across our teams, even though our teams work remotely. We take pride in our hard-earned, friendly, consensus-building, and ever-improving remote-first culture.<br>&#xA0;<br><strong>Working at Octopus may be different from any other job you&#x2019;ve had before.</strong> In many companies, software engineers are treated as an expense to reduce or a revenue stream to increase. In contrast, Octopus is a product company built from the ground up by engineers, for engineers. At Octopus your effort will be appreciated because you are adding value to our products, which are our assets. Also, our customers are people just like us. This makes it easy to relate to our customers and understand what they care about most.<br>&#xA0;<br><strong>Octopus is not done.</strong> Many of us came to Octopus thinking &#x201C;it does everything I want, how can I possibly help?&#x201D; Continual changes in the software landscape present a constant stream of opportunities for us to explore. We will continue to make Octopus the best tool in its class by increasing the value Octopus offers, pushing into new territory beyond deployment automation, all the while making Octopus easier and more delightful to use for both simple and complex scenarios alike. If you like solving distributed computing problems, building delightful user experiences, or anything in between, you can do that with us.<br>&#xA0;<br><strong>Octopus is not a startup.</strong> We do not need venture capital, we have been a sustainably profitable business from day one. We care about building a sustainable company and we do this by helping customers succeed, leaving increased revenue as a happy byproduct.<br>&#xA0;<br><em>Keep reading if you want more details about the job.

If you&apos;ve ever had a maintenance issue at your housing rental, you know how much of a pain it can be to get it fixed quickly and reliably. This pain is felt by everyone involved, from the resident to the coordinator to the technician doing the actual repairs. It doesn&apos;t have to be this way.</p><p>Our mission is threefold:</p><p>1. Provide a positive experience for all participants in the property maintenance process 2. Intelligently improve efficiency</p><p>3. Deliver transparency and a sense of control</p><p>We&#x2019;re a small but growing company with funding and hundreds of happy customers. Over the past five years, we&#x2019;ve homed in on the challenges our customers face when running their maintenance department, namely, running an efficient maintenance department requires cooperation, communication, and the ability to see through the fog to focus on what actually matters. The stakes are high for our customers. A bad maintenance experience is the number one reason renters move out when they otherwise wouldn&#x2019;t have. If property repairs take too long or cost too much property managers are on the hook both financially and legally. With over 30 million units for rent in the United States alone the opportunity is sizeable.</p><p>Your contributions will be critical to the success of our customers and Property Meld. Our core product is a multitenant web application that services hundreds of thousands of users. You&#x2019;ll occasionally wear multiple hats and will need to quickly come up to speed on various parts of the application. You can expect to be responsible for the entire lifecycle of a given project &#x2013; that is, engineering design, estimation, development, deployment, and monitoring. We&#x2019;re pragmatic about engineering decisions and prioritize rapidly and consistently delivering value to our customers above all else.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll have the freedom to choose how to solve problems, given the constraints of the business and infrastructure. With this freedom, you&#x2019;ll be expected to make sound decisions and to swiftly iterate on them until they are either successful or we&#x2019;ve learned a new direction would be more prudent. Many of the challenges you will encounter won&#x2019;t have any low hanging fruit left.

We are focusing on the backend and are looking for some strong colleagues to work on python development projects. Our entire backend architecture is heavily built with python and you&apos;re expected to know your way around the language.</p><p>We have a core backend pipeline that runs web scrapers on a daily basis, aggregating data from multiple sources in multiple countries. This data is feed through a pipeline that cleans and updates the data continuously. This aggregated data can be viewed by our users on the Seez apps. We&#xA0;apply machine learning on multiple&#xA0;projects. The new projects will build upon&#xA0;the current architecture and some will be completely independent projects that may re-use some of the existing infrastructure. On these new projects we will be working with external partners across Europe and other regions to build a new online car buying journey.</p><p><strong>A quick overview of our backend technology stack:</strong></p><ol><li>Python 3 (Flask, FastAPI, Scrapy)</li><li>Redis and Celery</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Docker</li><li>Linux</li><li>Firebase</li><li>Odoo ERP</li></ol><p>You will have freedom, you will be challenged, and you will not be shut down due to bureaucracy, but your voice will be heard. You are expected to be able to handle multiple tasks and shouldn&apos;t be afraid to take on challenges. However, you are expected to consider the challenges and be able to propose feedback. You will be part of a team and you are expected to pull on your teammates when need, but also be able to run on your own and actively seek&#xA0;feedback on&#xA0;projects.</p><p>We value communication very highly and you will be expected to participate and join discussions in product development as well as company direction, lastly, you are not a code monkey. We have a very free and open minded culture and are preferably looking for someone with the same mentality.</p><p>We value growing our team and there will be plenty of opportunities for you to jump into our other projects and get familiar with our other projects. You will be a part of a distributed team from the Middle East and across Europe. We will only accept applicants that are within +2 hours of CEST. Daily communication is done through Slack and we use Zoom extensively.
