Cyber threats are ever present and constantly evolving, leaving major companies all over the world at risk. This is where ThreatConnect steps in. So if you&#x2019;re interested in having a real impact on the security landscape of these companies by working on an intelligent innovative product, this might be the role for you.</p><p>Job descriptions are by nature, extremely specific.

You relish the idea of applying your skills to other facets of your life outside of work.

We&apos;re looking for a Software Engineer to join our small team to build, own and scale the distribution of Raycast extensions via a store that developers around the world can contribute to.</p><p>Raycast is a native Mac application with a significant focus on top-notch UI and interactions. We genuinely care about user experience, performance, privacy and ease of use. We had enough of dealing with slow and clunky tools. Raycast is our attempt to let you enjoy your daily workflows without all the distractions.</p><p>When Apple announced the App Store in 2008, the distribution of software changed over night. Suddenly, developers could reach millions of customers. We believe it&apos;s about time to change how developers discover and consume productivity tools. At the center of this, is a store full of Raycast extensions that people can share and manage or discover new ones from others. We need hungry engineers that architect and build this store to revolutionise how developers experience productivity tools with us.</p><p>We&apos;re a fully remote company and looking for candidates in the UTC timezone (London, Lisbon, Dakar, ...) &#xB1; 3 hours. This position is for a full-time employment.</p><p><strong>In this role you will...</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build the infrastructure of our store.</strong>&#xA0;You design a stable cloud infrastructure and backend architecture that is open for extension, and an API that other developers love to use. You&apos;re implementing the distribution of our extensions and work closely with macOS engineering where needed.</li><li><strong>Co-own the product and work self-directed.</strong>&#xA0;We&apos;re a small team of individual contributors. Everybody has autonomy and responsibility. You work on features from ideation over release to maintenance and shape the roadmap of the product.</li><li><strong>Shape the experience for contributors.</strong> The store is one piece of the puzzle. You generate ideas about how developers should add and maintain extensions. You optimise for ease-of-use for producers and consumers.</li><li><strong>Improve performance and care about quality.</strong> You dogfood your own features with our nightly builds, respond to user feedback in our community and jump into performance profiling to make API calls fast. You automate tedious tasks. At best, directly in Raycast.</li><li><strong>Wear many hats.</strong> In a small startup, we&apos;re all generalists. You might add a new page to our Vue.js website, set up infrastructure components, or write a blog post about a new feature.</li></ul><p><strong>You will be a great fit if...</strong></p><ul><li><strong>You know how to build great APIs.</strong>&#xA0;Ideally, you&apos;ve built and scaled APIs before and have a playbook to kickstart development with modern backend languages. You&apos;ve worked with different types of data stores, and you know best practices around data modeling and access. Moreover, you can reason well about the tradeoffs of different programming languages and tech stacks without being dogmatic, f.e. decide if we should adopt GraphQL or REST.</li><li><strong>You&apos;re highly productive while writing quality code.</strong> We release updates every 1-2 weeks. You can break down big projects in small deliverables. You care about the outcome and take a pragmatic approach to deliver it. You keep things simple and rather write more code than adopting a third-party dependency. You know when you want a code review or need to write tests.</li><li><strong>You&apos;re product-minded.</strong> You have a sense for great user experience and feel when something is off. You work with continuous deployment and preview environments to get constant feedback and you have monitoring and analytics in place to quickly act when something unexpected happens. You&apos;re eager to optimize API responsiveness and dig deep when there is a need to resolve a tricky issue. You treat APIs as products and proactively iterate on them.</li><li><strong>You put our users first.</strong> Throughout Raycast you find many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raycastapp/status/1322188380403281921?s=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">little details</a>. You pay attention to detail and provide our users a delightful experience. You can&apos;t stand bugs and don&apos;t shy away from user feedback.</li><li><strong>You&apos;re an empathetic communicator.</strong> You treat technology as tradeoffs. You may be opinionated but you&apos;re not ideological. When disagreeing, you communicate thoughtfully your perspective and compromise when needed. You&apos;re thriving in a team environment and hold your colleagues accountable.</li></ul><p><strong>Application process</strong></p><p>During our interview process, we want to make sure that both sides get a good understanding of what it feels to work together day-to-day. Our process contains a few steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Send us an engaging email.</strong>&#xA0;Tell us why you want to join Raycast and why you generally care about the problem we&apos;re solving. Make your first impression count. Share with us what excites you and how you envision your role at Raycast.</li><li><strong>An intro call with the founders.</strong>&#xA0;Both parties get to know each other. You learn more about Raycast and can ask us any question. From our side, we want to understand what motivated you to apply.</li><li><strong>Work on a real task.</strong> We want to demonstrate how it is to collaborate with the team. For this, we give you an assignment that we would actually build and create a shared Slack channel to communicate.

The main deliverable of the team is a stream of betting opportunities.</p><p>The team is currently working on&#xA0;enhancing the depth and the breadth of our offer, which translates to adding support for more sophisticated betting opportunities as well as&#xA0;new sports.&#xA0;</p><p>Whilst we are currently consuming betting opportunities from third-party data sources, the mid-term goal of the team is to gradually shift to a model where we have less reliance on third-party data sources. Meaning that the full life-cycle of the betting opportunities will be managed in-house.&#xA0;One of such initiatives revolves around the implementation of in-house statistical models that will power our virtual sports offer.&#xA0;</p><p>The nature of the data handled by the team requires us to obey strict SLAs around the propagation times for any kind of update. Guaranteeing low latency is of utmost importance in order to prevent shrewd players taking advantage of stale data (e.g. odds taking too long to be updated after a goal is scored in a football match).</p><p>You will be working on developing and improving our core services primarily in Scala and also have a voice in architectural discussions.</p><p><strong><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Our programming language of choice is Scala with focus on functional programming</li><li>We build distributed systems using Akka Cluster</li><li>Event sourcing using Akka Persistence Cassandra with projections in PostgreSQL</li><li>Apache Pulsar as a message bus</li></ul><p><strong>About You</strong></p><ul><li>You have good problem-solving skills, a tendency towards simple and effective solutions, and a &#x201C;getting things done&#x201D; mentality</li><li>Analytical thinking, troubleshooting skills, attention to detail</li><li>You are a reliable, trustworthy person that keeps their promises</li><li>Interested in keeping yourself up to date and learning new technologies</li><li>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</li><li>Able to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</li><li>Have good communication skills in verbal and written English</li></ul><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location.

That&#x2019;s what we call a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> who works on our <strong>mobile and web apps</strong>. (&#x201C;Front-end&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t really capture everything involved. Feel free to use the term, we&#x2019;re trying to make it a thing.)</p><p>Using your knowledge of <strong>React and React Native</strong>, you&#x2019;ll work alongside other engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle everything from huge company initiatives to modest but important bug fixes, <strong>from start to finish</strong>. You&#x2019;ll also collaborate with your product team on discovery, helping to assess the direction and feasibility of product changes. And, perhaps most importantly, you&#x2019;ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team.</p><p><strong>Why CompanyCam?</strong></p><p>Did you wake up this morning with a burning desire to create apps for contractors? No? I didn&#x2019;t think so. I admit, it&#x2019;s not something one thinks about without some prompting. But bear with me for a moment...</p><p>Contractors are <em>everywhere</em>. They build our homes, they literally put roofs over our heads, they wire up our electricity, give us access to the internet, fix our plumbing and AC, paint our homes&#x2026;the list goes on.&#xA0;</p><p>At CompanyCam, you&#x2019;ll work with intelligent, kind people to make contractors&apos; work easier. You&apos;ll create time for them so they can get shit done and spend more time with their families. Sound corny? You&#x2019;ll find that midwesterner ethos permeate our culture (we&#x2019;re based in Lincoln, NE), so if you can&#x2019;t hang with that, no hard feelings, but this probably isn&#x2019;t the role for you.</p><p><strong>Working At CompanyCam</strong></p><p>Our Product and Engineering departments do things a little differently.&#xA0;</p><p>We use Basecamp&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shape Up</a> method (fused with empowered product teams a la Marty Cagan&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=inspired&amp;qid=1591733279&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inspired</a>) to organize and execute our work.&#xA0;That means you&#x2019;ll work in a close-knit team consisting of a product manager, a product designer, and other engineers on an area of the product in 6-week cycles. During cycles you&apos;ll spend&#xA0;most&#xA0;of your time&#xA0;implementing&#xA0;product improvements, but you&apos;ll also work with&#xA0;your&#xA0;team shaping (generating and vetting) product improvements for next cycle. After each cycle you&#x2019;ll get a 1-2 week cool-down where you&#x2019;ll pursue educational opportunities, work on pet projects, or smash some bugs that have been nagging at you. Rinse and repeat until code nirvana.</p><p>Sounds nice, right? <strong>No sprinting, no scrumming, no death by 1,000 meetings</strong>. We protect our engineers&apos; time, treat them like adults, and trust them to get their work done. We&#x2019;re also big on not overworking people. Put in your eight hours of focused, quality work and then TURN. SLACK. OFF. <strong>No nights and weekends</strong>.</p><p>Our larger company culture is also refreshingly chill. We have fun, learn from each other, and don&#x2019;t take ourselves too seriously.</p><p>We cover the important stuff too. We <strong>pay well,</strong> offer <strong>unlimited vacation</strong>, <strong>meaningful equity</strong>, <strong>health insurance</strong>, and other benefits. If you&apos;re local or down to move, we&#x2019;re custom remodeling a new office space in the Lincoln Haymarket area that you&#x2019;ll love. If you&apos;re remote (most of the engineering team is), we&#x2019;re well set up with great conference room video equipment so you&apos;ll feel like you&#x2019;re there with us, and once life is back to normal we&#x2019;ll fly you in a few times a year to hang out.</p><p><strong>What We Ask Of You</strong></p><p><strong>Must-haves</strong>These are our non-negotiables:</p><ul><li><strong>Show up</strong>: give us your best and&#xA0;have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.</li><li><strong>Grow up</strong>: take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.</li><li><strong>Do good</strong>: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.</li><li>Strong experience with and knowledge of <strong>React and/or React Native.</strong></li><li>Experience working as a professional software engineer.

That means you&#x2019;ll work in a close-knit team consisting of a product manager, a product designer, and other engineers on an area of the product in 6-week cycles. During cycles you&apos;ll spend most of your time implementing product improvements, but you&apos;ll also work with your team shaping (generating and vetting) product improvements for next cycle. After each cycle you&#x2019;ll get a 1-2 week cool-down where you&#x2019;ll pursue educational opportunities, work on pet projects, or smash some bugs that have been nagging at you. Rinse and repeat until code nirvana.</p><p>Sounds nice, right? <strong>No sprinting, no scrumming, no death by 1,000 meetings</strong>. We protect our engineers&apos; time, treat them like adults, and trust them to get their work done. We&#x2019;re also big on not overworking people. Put in your eight hours of focused, quality work and then TURN. SLACK. OFF. <strong>No nights and weekends</strong>.</p><p>Our larger company culture is also refreshingly chill. We have fun, learn from each other, and don&#x2019;t take ourselves too seriously.</p><p>We cover the important stuff too. We <strong>pay well</strong>, offer <strong>unlimited vacation</strong>, <strong>meaningful equity, health insurance</strong>, and other benefits. If you&apos;re local or down to move, we&#x2019;re custom remodeling a new office space in the Lincoln Haymarket area that you&#x2019;ll love. If you&apos;re remote (most of the engineering team is), we&#x2019;re well set up with great conference room video equipment so you&apos;ll feel like you&#x2019;re there with us, and once life is back to normal we&#x2019;ll fly you in a few times a year to hang out.</p><p><strong>What We Ask Of You</strong></p><p><strong>Must-haves</strong></p><p>These are our non-negotiables:</p><ul><li><strong>Show up</strong>: have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.</li><li><strong>Grow up</strong>: take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.</li><li><strong>Do good</strong>: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.</li><li>Strong experience with and knowledge of <strong>Ruby on Rails.</strong></li><li>Experience working as a professional software engineer. (Sorry, we&apos;re not hiring new devs at this time.)</li><li><strong>Reside permanently and currently somewhere in the continental US. </strong>Alas, we&apos;re not set up to hire outside of the US.</li></ul><p><strong>Nice-to-haves</strong></p><p>Day to day, you&#x2019;ll spend 90%+ of your time working in&#xA0;<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, but, of course, that&#x2019;s not all you&#x2019;ll work with. While experience with the following technologies are <em>not required</em> (we&#x2019;re cool with some on-the-job learning), you will see them with varying levels of frequency:</p><ul><li>GraphQL &amp; REST</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Redis</li><li>AWS services (S3, EC2, etc)</li><li>ElasticSearch</li><li>MongoDB</li></ul><p><em>This position can be U.S. Remote or in our Lincoln office.
