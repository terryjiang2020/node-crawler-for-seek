More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we&#x2019;re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1)&#xA0;<strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips</strong>: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2)&#xA0;<strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice</strong>: WalletHub&#x2019;s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3)&#xA0;<strong>Wallet Surveillance</strong>: Personal finance isn&#x2019;t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they&#x2019;re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>            </div>        "},{"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/481201/senior-full-stack-engineer-m-f-d-lumiform","name":"Senior Full-Stack Engineer (m/f/d)","position":"Senior Full-Stack Engineer (m/f/d)","date":"2021-01-04T19:33:29.237Z","company":"Lumiform","companyIcon":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ub74Z.png?s=48","time":"3h ago","location":"Berlin, Germany","area":null,"country":null,"tags":["vue.js","vuex","php","laravel","mysql"],"email":null,"apply_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/481201/senior-full-stack-engineer-m-f-d-lumiform","description":"                <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">About this job</h2><br></br>                <div class=\"grid job-details--about gs16 gsx sm:fd-column fs-body2 fc-medium\">                        <div class=\"grid--cell6\">                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Job type: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Full-time</span>                                </div>                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Experience level: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Senior</span>                                </div>                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Role: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Frontend Developer, Full Stack Developer</span>                                </div>                        </div>                        <div class=\"grid--cell6\">                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Industry: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">B2B, Computer Software, SaaS</span>                                </div>                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Company size: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">11&#x2013;50 people</span>                                </div>                                <div class=\"mb8\">                                    <span>Company type: </span>                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">VC Funded</span>                                </div>                        </div>                </div>                            <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">Remote details</h2><br></br>                <div class=\"grid job-details--about gs16 gsx sm:fd-column fs-body2 fc-medium\">                    <div class=\"ml8 mr8\">                                                                            <div class=\"mb8\">                                <span>Office Location:</span>                                <span class=\"fw-bold\">Berlin, Germany.</span>                                    <span class=\"fs-caption\">Employees can also work full time from this office.</span>                            </div>                                                                    </div>                </div>                        <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">Job description</h2><br></br>            <div><p>Lumiform is a VC-backed SaaS start-up based in Berlin, Germany, but operating globally.</p><p>Our goal is to transform internal inspections in a massive, untapped market which still relies on pen &amp; paper.&#xA0;We enable&#xA0;companies&#xA0;to&#xA0;simplify and digitalize their inspection workflows&#xA0;to&#xA0;improve&#xA0;quality&#xA0;&amp; safety and save time.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p>We are looking for a passionate full-stack&#xA0;engineer who gets the chance to work on all&#xA0;levels of&#xA0;our stack.

The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.&#xA0;&#xA0;<strong>Importance of Engineering</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;We build systems that are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. Our systems help today&#x2019;s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.&#xA0;&#xA0;Counting people in &#x201C;real-time&#x201D; is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room&#x2019;s occupancy increment 700ms later.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Today alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.&#xA0;&#xA0;We&#x2019;re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We&#x2019;re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We&#x2019;re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.&#xA0;&#xA0;Real-time can solve one of the world&#x2019;s most fundamental problems -- how do humans use all this space? Last week we launched&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.density.io/safe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Safe by Density</a>&#xA0;to help organizations safely return to the workplace. This product, a singular example, would not have been possible without real time data.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This is a large, nuanced, deeply technical problem.
