Imagine a B2B SaaS app that doesn&#x2019;t look like garbage, built by a <a href=\"https://companycam.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\">team of capable, laid back people</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But don&#x2019;t let the chill throw you off; we&#x2019;re a fast-growing, product-led startup with big plans for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re looking for a sharp, self-motivated, problem-solving <strong>infrastructure engineer</strong>to join our team.</p>\n<p>Using your knowledge of <strong>infrastructure</strong>&#xA0;and <strong>devops&#xA0;technologies</strong>, you&#x2019;ll work on our Platform Team to improve our logging, monitoring, and notifications systems, improve and automate our security infrastructure, improve our infrastructure and application deployment strategy; and create tools to enable reliable, fast, scalable, and secure work on our product teams.</p>\n<p>And, perhaps most importantly, you&#x2019;ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team.</p>\n<p><strong>Why CompanyCam?</strong></p>\n<p>Did you wake up this morning with a burning desire to create apps for contractors? No? I didn&#x2019;t think so. I admit, it&#x2019;s not something one thinks about without some prompting. But bear with me for a moment...</p>\n<p>Contractors are <em>everywhere</em>. They build our homes, they literally put roofs over our heads, they wire up our electricity, give us access to the internet, fix our plumbing and AC, paint our homes&#x2026;the list goes on.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>At CompanyCam, you&#x2019;ll work with intelligent, kind people to make contractors&apos; work easier. You&apos;ll create time for them so they can get shit done and spend more of that time with their families. Sound corny? You&#x2019;ll find that midwesterner ethos permeate our culture (we&#x2019;re based in Lincoln, NE), so if you can&#x2019;t hang with that, no hard feelings, but this probably isn&#x2019;t the role for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Working At CompanyCam</strong></p>\n<p>Our Product and Engineering departments work together on basically two types of teams. Most teams focus on the product itself, while the platform team supports that work, and also works on larger and more fundamental systems and maintenance, infrastructure, and devops.</p>\n<p>Product teams use Basecamp&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shape Up</a> method (fused with empowered product teams a la Marty Cagan&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=inspired&amp;qid=1591733279&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inspired</a>) to organize and execute their work. That means they work in teams in 6-week cycles to implement product improvements. After each cycle, everyone enjoys a 1-2 week cool-down where they pursue educational opportunities, work on pet projects, or smash some bugs that have been nagging at them.</p>\n<p>As an infrastructure engineer, you&apos;ll work on our Platform Team and follow the same 6-week cycle + 1-2 week cool-down template.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Sounds nice, right? <strong>No sprinting, no scrumming, no death by 1,000 meetings</strong>. We protect our engineers&apos; time, treat them like adults, and trust them to get their work done. We&#x2019;re also big on not overworking people. Put in your eight hours of focused, quality work and then TURN. SLACK. OFF. <strong>No nights and weekends</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our larger company culture is also refreshingly chill. We have fun, learn from each other, and don&#x2019;t take ourselves too seriously.</p>\n<p>We cover the important stuff too. We <strong>pay well</strong>, offer <strong>unlimited vacation</strong>, <strong>meaningful equity, health insurance</strong>, and other benefits. If you&apos;re local or down to move, we&#x2019;re custom remodeling a new office space in the Lincoln Haymarket area that you&#x2019;ll love. If you&apos;re remote (most of the engineering team is), we&#x2019;re well set up with great conference room video equipment so you&apos;ll feel like you&#x2019;re there with us, and once life is back to normal we&#x2019;ll fly you in a few times a year to hang out.</p>\n<p><strong>What We Ask Of You</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Must-haves<br></strong>These are our non-negotiables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Show up</strong>: have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.</li>\n<li><strong>Grow up</strong>: take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.</li>\n<li><strong>Do good</strong>: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.</li>\n<li>Experience with using <strong>Terraform</strong> to modularize and deploy infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Experience deploying infrastructure to <strong>AWS</strong> via automation.</li>\n<li>Experience working with <strong>Ubuntu</strong> systems and knowledge of SSH, SystemD, and Nginx.</li>\n<li>Proficiency with <strong>EC2</strong>, <strong>RDS</strong>, <strong>API Gateway</strong>, and <strong>Lambda</strong>.</li>\n<li>Experience working as a professional infrastructure engineer.

Recent, hands-on experience coding both server side (C#) and client side (JavaScript) are strongly suggested, and 5+ years work experience as a professional programmer is required. &#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Experience Wireframing UI &amp; Designing APIs -</strong> You do not have to have strong artistic skills, but you should be comfortable not only spec-ing out UI wireframes but also designing the supporting technical web service API&#x2019;s and/or client side component API&#x2019;s.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Project Management</strong>: &#xA0;You should be highly organized with a strong history in either technical project management or as the lead developer for complex software development projects.&#xA0;&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Customer Facing</strong>: comfortable meeting with sophisticated customers and managing expectations on large high value projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>MapLarge is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.

We&apos;re in the midst of a comprehensive redesign of the look and feel of our product, and we&apos;re seeing years of foundational work realized in developer productivity and value delivered to our users. Your opportunity is to join us in implementing design principles of usability, and discoverability, and in making good on our promise to enable our users to go on better rides more often. We&apos;ve built a strong presence in the cycling community over the past 10+ years, and we&apos;re committed to supporting the core features and values important to our long term supporters. We do not require prior React experience; we are much more interested in candidates who are excited about what we&apos;re building, and who can&apos;t wait to help us improve products that make cycling better for our millions of users. That said, in order to excel in this position, we do expect multiple years of experience putting complex, functional code in front of users at scale. At this time, we are not accepting junior developers.</p>\n<p>Technology that we regularly use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React</li>\n<li>Babel</li>\n<li>Webpack</li>\n<li>NodeJS</li>\n<li>Figma</li>\n<li>CircleCI for frontend CI</li>\n<li>Jenkins for backend CI</li>\n<li>GitHub for version control</li>\n<li>Existing code is traditional Rails and HAML/SASS based templating, as well as Backbone and sundry other Javascript. All new frontend development is done in React.</li>\n<li>OpenStreetMap rendering and routing stack (mapnik, postGIS, TileMill for style dev, GraphHopper based routing). Bonus points if you have map styling experience!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>We offer a competitive salary as well as health, dental and vision insurance, and a 401k with a 10% match. You&apos;ll be equipped with a new Macbook Pro, iMac, or Linux machine, a standing desk and any other productivity tools that are needed. We strongly believe in testing our own software, and as a result are more than happy to help defray some of the costs of cycling, including offering a one-time new bicycle stipend.</p>\n<p>In light of the global pandemic, Ride with GPS is working remotely and offers a stipend for setting up a home office. Moving forward, employees will be able to work from home indefinitely, and we are also monitoring health guidelines and hope to offer an option to work in a shared office environment when it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>What&apos;s Next?</strong></p>\n<p>We are based in Portland, OR and encourage residents across Oregon and Washington to apply by emailing <a href=\"mailto:careers@ridewithgps.com\">careers@ridewithgps.com</a> with your resume and an overview of any work relevant to the position. Please include at least a paragraph explaining your relationship with cycling, and optionally a cover letter with your pronouns. We&apos;ll respond in a timely manner and move things forward for promising candidates.</p>\n<p>Ride with GPS is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming workplace for all members of our staff. We believe having a diverse team makes our product and our company better, and we are working to ensure our reality reflects those ideals.

Maybe we need a slackbot to allow customer service to quickly solve tickets without having to jump between multiple platforms. Maybe we need to move app logic from client-side to the server and build out an API. Maybe&#xA0;we need a design&#xA0;built&#xA0;out&#xA0;into react components.</p>\n<p>This is why we need a full-stack developer - you&apos;ll touch all different areas of our businesses and tech stack.&#xA0;Sounds like fun, yeah?</p>\n<p><strong>More About Our Tech Stack</strong></p>\n<p>You must know React and Firebase (Functions, Firestore, RTDB - at the very least). We use React heavily in our front end development. You must also be&#xA0;strong - not &quot;I&apos;ve tried it&quot;, but&#xA0;&quot;I&apos;ve used it in real projects&quot; strong - with Typescript. We currently use SCSS modules in React, so you should be comfortable with SCSS even if you want to convince us that something better exists.</p>\n<p>You should know how to build Express apps or lambda/serverless functions, and how to interact with GraphQL and/or REST APIs. If you have experience in Swift, Kotlin, or React Native, that&apos;s a plus.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>What You Need To Qualify</strong></p>\n<p>This is a full-time position or contract-to-hire position depending on your situation and needs. To qualify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be a US citizen or resident alien</li>\n<li>Proven work experience as&#xA0;full-stack developer with React &amp; Typescript (we&apos;ll need code examples or Github links)</li>\n<li>Proficiency working in git and terminal</li>\n<li>A portfolio and/or repo of actual work experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p>\n<p>Send us your details - we need to see your work and resume or similar doc. We&#x2019;ll reach out to qualified candidates via email to ask some questions or for a phone conversation.</p>            </div>\n        "},{"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/470801/cloud-engineer-higher-logic","name":"Cloud Engineer","position":"Cloud Engineer","date":"2020-12-14T10:16:15.609Z","company":"Higher Logic","companyIcon":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CWjYo.png?s=48","time":"2d ago","location":"No office location","area":null,"country":null,"tags":["cloud","amazon-web-services","python","windows"],"email":null,"apply_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/470801/cloud-engineer-higher-logic","description":"\n                <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">About this job</h2>\n                <div class=\"grid job-details--about gs16 gsx sm:fd-column fs-body2 fc-medium\">\n                        <div class=\"grid--cell6\">\n                                <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                    <span>Job type: </span>\n                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Full-time</span>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                    <span>Experience level: </span>\n                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Mid-Level</span>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                    <span>Industry: </span>\n                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Collaboration Tools, Enterprise Software</span>\n                                </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"grid--cell6\">\n                                <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                    <span>Company size: </span>\n                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">201&#x2013;500 people</span>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                    <span>Company type: </span>\n                                    <span class=\"fw-bold\">Private</span>\n                                </div>\n                        </div>\n                </div>\n            \n                <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">Remote details</h2>\n                <div class=\"grid job-details--about gs16 gsx sm:fd-column fs-body2 fc-medium\">\n                    <div class=\"ml8 mr8\">\n                                                    <div class=\"mb8\">\n                                <span>Preferred Timezone:</span>\n                                <span class=\"fw-bold\">(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time </span>\n                            </div>\n                                                                                            </div>\n                </div>\n            \n            <h2 class=\"fs-subheading mb16 fc-dark\">Job description</h2>\n            <div>\n<p>This is a full-time position with the Engineering Team.

Engineers develop an app (vetting available in React Web, React Native, or Node...or all of them!) and discuss it with one of our real, human experts - no whiteboarding or algorithms. Your app and follow up conversation not only grant you access to available contracts, but are displayed proudly on your profile so that&#xA0;potential clients can see what you can do.&#xA0;Say goodbye to hunting for work, waiting on late payments,&#xA0;complex contracts and paperwork, and working on dying tech - we handle all&#xA0;that stuff so you can do what you do best.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>G2i is short for &quot;Good News to the Internet.&quot; We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&#xA0;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&#xA0;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.</p>\n<p><strong>Your background</strong></p>\n<p>In simple terms we want engineers that take pride in their craft, are never satisfied with their knowledge base, and get excited about building applications in React, React Native, and/or Node. We look for people comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and display strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have 1+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of React Native and/or React production experience.</li>\n<li>You want to blow us away with your skillset&#xA0;- our code challenge often takes 6-8 hours to complete&#xA0;within ~7 days.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.</li>\n<li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.</li>\n<li>You might have&#xA0;other experience with Rails, Python, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&#xA0;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don&apos;t, that&apos;s OK too!</li>\n<li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests. You also understand that freelancing can come with potential downtime.</li>\n<li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients</strong></p>\n<p>G2i also vets clients so that you&apos;ll be contracting with clients that place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.</p>\n<p>When we vet clients we make sure they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize communication</li>\n<li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines</li>\n<li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we vet engineers we make sure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineers vet other engineers</li>\n<li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding</li>\n<li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored</li>\n<li>Our process is completely transparent</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Who you will work with</strong></p>\n<p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator</a>&#xA0;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity</strong></p>\n<p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer.

We are an international collective&#xA0;of industry leaders, conference speakers, and subject matter experts within React, React Native and Node that are passionate about working remotely and doing good in the world.</p>\n<p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients. Say goodbye to hunting business, drawing up contracts, and working on dying tech. With one production focused, to the point code challenge (no whiteboarding or algorithms + on your own time) vetted by our engineering team, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to receive curated contract opportunities as well as become a part of an international collective of experts. If that sounds up your alley or you would like to find out more, please feel free to reach out to <a href=\"mailto:dylan@g2i.co\">dylan@g2i.co</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>G2i is short for &quot;Good News to the Internet.&quot; We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&#xA0;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&#xA0;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.</p>\n<p><strong>Your background</strong></p>\n<p>In simple terms we want to hire an engineer that is excited about building applications in Node, is comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and has strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have 3+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of Node production experience.</li>\n<li>You are willing to complete a code challenge that often takes 6-8 hours to complete (there are no due dates or timers however).</li>\n<li>You live in North America or South America.</li>\n<li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.</li>\n<li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.</li>\n<li>You might have full-stack experience with either Rails, React, React Native, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&#xA0;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don&apos;t, that&apos;s OK too!</li>\n<li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests.</li>\n<li>You have prior experience working remotely or are excited about doing so.</li>\n<li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients</strong></p>\n<p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients who place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.</p>\n<p>When we vet clients we make sure they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize communication</li>\n<li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines</li>\n<li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we vet engineers we make sure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineers vet other engineers</li>\n<li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding</li>\n<li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored</li>\n<li>Our process is completely transparent</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Who you will work with</strong></p>\n<p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator</a>&#xA0;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity</strong></p>\n<p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer.
