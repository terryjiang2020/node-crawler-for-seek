Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out.</p>\n<p>We value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU.</p>\n<p>Our solution,&nbsp;<strong>Bimsync</strong>, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs. Many companies across the world are using our products to build better airports, hospitals, stadiums, homes and roads.</p>\n<p>Our technology stack runs 100% on AWS, using the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand.

A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is important, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it‚Äôs not a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>We define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company's working language is English, so we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken).</p>\n<p>You should have a good understanding of web technologies and the different challenges of mobile development, having previously developed mobile applications available in the app stores. We expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs in React Native, so previous experience on that stack is a plus. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs, with a bonus of being willing to get your hands dirty also on improving backend APIs when needed. At last, some previous experience of iOS and Android native toolchains would be great. </p>\n<h1 id=\"whatweoffer\">What we offer</h1>\n<p>You will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team.

Would you like to join us and help take the infrastructure that supports this leading design tool to the next level? We're looking to expand our team with a full-time&nbsp;<strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong>.</p>\n<p>At Sketch, we work with a unique technology blend: a cloud platform and macOS and iOS applications. Our cloud stack is based on a mix of serverless and traditional server applications built on Elixir and Go, along with other cloud services like RDS PostgreSQL, S3, SQS, √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Most pieces are deployed on AWS ECS and automated through Terraform; we use Chef for configuration management where it's needed. Our SRE team usually codes with Python whenever we need to write a small program or script.</p>\n<p>As a Site Reliability Engineer at Sketch, you will focus on shaping our cloud infrastructure and make sure all the pieces work well together: development environments, metrics processing and observability, security policies, network design, deployment strategies, high availability, etc. You will work closely with backend, frontend, Mac developers and product managers to guarantee product focussed, smooth engineering processes.</p>\n<p>As an example of one complex project we have worked on lately, we recently migrated our production database from MariaDB to PostgreSQL using streaming replication to minimise the potential downtime and have replicated environments to adapt and test our backend APIs properly.</p>\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n<p>We look for someone who has experience with different stacks (mainly Linux based), technologies and production models and has participated actively on the build of essential pieces of a cloud platform.</p>\n<p>Someone that knows how to conduct a technical operation that potentially affects users and at the same time can code small applications and scripts to automate the platform and also debug problems in other people's code.</p>\n<p>You care about security, code quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity.
