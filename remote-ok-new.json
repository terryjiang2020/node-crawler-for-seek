BTW, our web apps are built with Phoenix SSR and sprinkles of Javascript using StimulusJS, which reflects our pragmatic culture - we want to move fast and have reliable software with as few moving parts as possible.</p>\n<p>We’re offering $60-$80/hr+.

He or she will drive the technical evolution of our IoT sensor data pipeline and support our customer-facing web applications and data analysis tools. Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Oakland, CA.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Company</strong>\nAt Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.</p>\n<p>Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.</p>\n<p>We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action. Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.</p>\n<p>After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors here and here), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Team</strong>\nWe are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges. We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create. Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team. How else could you tackle a problem as complex and global as air pollution?</p>\n<p><strong>Job Description</strong>\nWe are seeking a highly self-motivated and passionate backend developer with a proven track record in delivering top-quality code and architectural solutions to bring our Clarity Cloud to the next level. Your key responsibilities will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leading development and maintenance of key system features, including APIs, workers, and databases.</li>\n<li>Interfacing with product management to brainstorm technical solutions to business requirements and evaluate technical feasibility of innovative product features.</li>\n<li>Working with other team members to investigate architecture best practices, design approaches and prototype new technology.</li>\n<li>Collaborating in an Agile environment to deliver high quality software against well established schedules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our product is multidisciplinary, ranging from ubiquitous IoT hardware to scalable data pipelines, advanced data quality assurance algorithms and insightful data analyses. You will enjoy freedom of action around these topics and be encouraged to take initiative for making our software offerings truly revolutionary in the clean-tech space. You will have plenty of opportunity to work closely with our customers and end-users who hail from industry, government, NGOs, community groups, and academia.

We work hard, keep it real and do it all for our customers by providing industry-leading tools, education and content.\\n\\nWe’re growing and we are looking to add a Principal Software Engineer - Architect to our fast-paced and customer-oriented Engineering team.\\n\\nWhere would this person be located? Great question! We’re a remote-first company and hope to hire this Principal Architect anywhere between the ET - PT time zones.\\n\\nInterested in learning more? Let’s get into the details: \\n\\n#&nbsp;**What you will be doing:**\\n* Execute. You will be the technical leader of one of our groups of sprint teams. You will help teams navigate technical problems and be the stalemate breaker when a decision can’t be made.\\n* Plan. You will work with product managers and team leads to play an active part in defining the roadmap and scoping features. \\n* Mentor. You will have frequent conversations with members of your group and proactive seek out opportunities to help develop their careers.\\n* Make recommendations. You will actively contribute to decisions around technologies to be used for new applications and improvements on existing applications\\n* Scale, maintain, and improve.

We’re thinking more than ten years.\\n* Technical people-person. You’re used to communicating technical details to non-technical coworkers as well as soliciting requirements and feedback to help you architect the most effective solution. You also love mentoring your team and working with both individual contributors and other leaders to pool your expertise and disseminate it to the rest of the department. \\n* Master classer. We’re looking for someone with a history of crushing their goals, a passion for high quality, effective solutions, and a strong desire to level up the entire team. \\n* Heavy toolbelt. You know your way around a web application -- how to build clean, complex, scalable APIs and how best to consume them on the client. You’ve worked on some legacy systems and built others from scratch, making all the mistakes along the way, and now you back up your decisions with a wealth of experience and context. You understand how your tools work in detail, knows when (and when not) to use them, and can show your team a thing or two.\\n* Technical leader. You will provide the technical vision and direction of the company, lead discussions that might constrain or broaden future architectural choices.\\n \\n\\n#&nbsp;**About Jungle Scout**\\nJungle Scout is the leading all-in-one tool for selling on Amazon, with the mission of providing powerful data and insights to help entrepreneurs and brands grow successful Amazon businesses. \\n\\nThe Jungle Scout team is a group of smart, motivated, and fun-loving professionals working hard to help our customers achieve success.
