Simply put, our business is growing and we‚Äôve taken our marketing machine as far as it can go given our expertise and time. We‚Äôre looking for someone far better than we are to dedicate themselves to improving our marketing.</p>\n<p>Duckbill presents a unique challenge for a product marketer: we operate three distinct lines-of-business with their own customer personas, GTM strategy, and sales approach. Each line of business works together, feeding each other and growing each other. Those lines of business are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our AWS cost management consulting, which is focused on enterprise B2B.</li>\n<li>Our media business, which operates multiple media publications and generates its own revenue via sponsorships.</li>\n<li>An as-yet-unannounced SaaS product that no one knows about.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your work will primarily focus on our consulting and SaaS at first, and we expect you‚Äôll naturally begin splitting time evenly between them after a while.</p>\n<p>You will be our first full-time marketing hire, taking over the duty from one of our founders (the CEO, whom you‚Äôll report to). This gives you the opportunity to shape a marketing function as it grows from its early days. You will be expected to get your hands dirty and execute on the plans you create. Our expectation is that you will figure out new ways for us to position, talk about, and take our products to market, which will naturally lead to a mix of contractors, agencies, and additional staff as we grow.</p>\n<p>While ‚Äúfirst marketing hire‚Äù causes some to dread the conversations around convincing everyone marketing is important, we‚Äôre happy to say you won‚Äôt have any of those issues here. We‚Äôre all big believers in the value and power of effective marketing here.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be responsible for determining the right marketing activities to do and ensuring their execution</li>\n<li>Regularly measure progress of our marketing activities and experiments, and make adjustments as needed</li>\n<li>Provide your marketing expertise to the founders as input to our marketing strategy.</li>\n<li>The content side of sales enablement is a big part of this role. You‚Äôll work closely with our sales staff to ensure they have the best collateral for their needs, as well as continually honing our messaging for both the sales team and for our website.</li>\n<li>We use a lot of email marketing in Duckbill in the form of automated funnels and some basic segmentation and personalization. We‚Äôre hoping to improve our segmentation and per-segment messaging. You‚Äôll be responsible for this end-to-end.</li>\n<li>Oversee the growth of our Media publications and ensure our total audience reach continues to grow. We‚Äôre currently experimenting with organic content, but we‚Äôre betting you have other great ideas.</li>\n<li>Talk to our customers and review customer feedback in pursuit of improving our positioning and messaging</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some example upcoming projects</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We‚Äôre releasing our first lead magnets along with automated email sequences to accompany them soon. We‚Äôd like to do more of these but aren‚Äôt sure which opportunities are the best for us.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôre beginning to experiment with content creation for SEO and organic traffic. There‚Äôs opportunity here for building a team of writers and an expansive content plan.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôd like to start some email marketing specifically for our target customer base, perhaps in the form of a monthly email newsletter.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôve learned of the power of webinars as a result of our work for sponsors, but haven‚Äôt yet started this ourselves. We‚Äôd like to experiment with them.</li>\n<li>Help us build the SaaS GTM plan--from scratch! We‚Äôve got some ideas, you‚Äôve got plenty more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>5-7 years of experience in an B2B SaaS startup in a marketing or product marketing role</li>\n<li>Significant experience in inbound, content-oriented marketing using both organic and paid tactics</li>\n<li>Prior experience in an early-stage startup. We‚Äôre a small company and you‚Äôll need to be used to working in one and all that entails.</li>\n<li>Prior experience leveraging a founder‚Äôs public influence to drive growth. Much of our lead generation is the result of our founders being active in public; you will need to leverage and grow that further, and prior experience doing so is important to us.</li>\n<li>You should be comfortable with writing a lot and reading even more. 90% of team communication within Duckbill is written, whether it‚Äôs Slack, a Google Doc, or email. We use long-form writing for communicating ideas and discussing them.</li>\n<li>US-based and legally authorized to work in the United States (sorry, Legal requires it üôÅ )</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nice-to-Haves</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior experience in the AWS cost optimization space. If you have it, awesome. If you don‚Äôt, no problem--you‚Äôll learn it with us.</li>\n<li>Prior experience with executives who build software products on AWS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compensation &amp; Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Compensation for this role ranges between $120,000 and $140,000 per year depending on experience; we do not provide equity. Yes, it‚Äôs lower than what you can get working for the latest unicorn, but we aren‚Äôt a unicorn. We‚Äôre more like your favorite horse--stable, reliable, and no-fuss. We won‚Äôt be ruining your life and relationships in pursuit of a lottery ticket. Instead, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to make a huge impact at an early-stage company while getting neck deep in cloud infrastructure, the most significant revolution in technology in the last two decades.</p>\n<p>We provide a 401(k) with a 100% match up to 6% of your salary. The 401(k) vests immediately, too.</p>\n<p>We provide healthcare, vision, and dental with premiums fully covered by the company. Of course trans benefits are covered; trans rights are human rights. Dependents are covered 50%.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúUnlimited PTO‚Äù is often misused to pressure employees into taking less vacation than they should, so we offer 3 weeks of PTO that accrue monthly, plus unlimited sick leave.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPaid parental leave‚Äù is challenging for a small company. Being a parent is far more challenging, so we of course offer paid parental leave for new parents of any gender.</p>\n<p>We provide an allowance of up to $3,000 for setting up your home office, or we‚Äôll cover the cost of a membership at a coworking space.</p>\n<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\n<p>We look for three things in every candidate: smart, humble, and hungry. That is, we actively seek out people to join us who are emotionally intelligent, desire to build up the team rather than solely themselves, and passionately pursue goals and outcomes.</p>\n<p>We are a fully remote company with team members in San Francisco, Portland, NYC, and more. We‚Äôre a small company (you‚Äôd be employee #9!) and a young company (our two year anniversary is March 1, 2021).</p>\n<p>We are not venture-funded, and have no intention of becoming so. We‚Äôre financed instead by the magic of revenue and profitability.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</strong></p>\n<p>We‚Äôre building a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other. We hire adults. We value transparency, autonomy, experimentation, and kind, direct feedback. We welcome nontraditional candidates, and people of all backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives.

Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out.</p>\n<p>We value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU.</p>\n<p>Our solution,&nbsp;<strong>Bimsync</strong>, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs. Many companies across the world are using our products to build better airports, hospitals, stadiums, homes and roads.</p>\n<p>Our technology stack runs 100% on AWS, using the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand. Our backend is mostly in Java and frontend in Javascript, using React and React Native for our mobile app (iOS and Android).</p>\n<h1 id=\"role\">Role</h1>\n<p>We are looking for a passionate React Native Engineer that wants to own and help shape our mobile application for the construction site. The main responsibility for this role is to produce high quality code that creates pixel perfect UIs according to design specs.</p>\n<p>In this role you will be working as part of a small and highly effective 100% remote team, consisting of a tech lead, product owner and designer.</p>\n<p>As the main developer in the team, you will be part of all major technical decisions, creating new features for the mobile app and participating in the release process on the app stores, including QA.</p>\n<h1 id=\"whatwearelookingfor\">What we are looking for</h1>\n<p>We believe in a growing and learning mindset, where people will be up to face a new challenge and learn a new technology when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is important, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it‚Äôs not a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>We define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company's working language is English, so we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken).</p>\n<p>You should have a good understanding of web technologies and the different challenges of mobile development, having previously developed mobile applications available in the app stores. We expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs in React Native, so previous experience on that stack is a plus. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs, with a bonus of being willing to get your hands dirty also on improving backend APIs when needed. At last, some previous experience of iOS and Android native toolchains would be great. </p>\n<h1 id=\"whatweoffer\">What we offer</h1>\n<p>You will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations and develop, as we learn.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth.

Would you like to join us and help take the infrastructure that supports this leading design tool to the next level? We're looking to expand our team with a full-time&nbsp;<strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong>.</p>\n<p>At Sketch, we work with a unique technology blend: a cloud platform and macOS and iOS applications. Our cloud stack is based on a mix of serverless and traditional server applications built on Elixir and Go, along with other cloud services like RDS PostgreSQL, S3, SQS, √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Most pieces are deployed on AWS ECS and automated through Terraform; we use Chef for configuration management where it's needed. Our SRE team usually codes with Python whenever we need to write a small program or script.</p>\n<p>As a Site Reliability Engineer at Sketch, you will focus on shaping our cloud infrastructure and make sure all the pieces work well together: development environments, metrics processing and observability, security policies, network design, deployment strategies, high availability, etc. You will work closely with backend, frontend, Mac developers and product managers to guarantee product focussed, smooth engineering processes.</p>\n<p>As an example of one complex project we have worked on lately, we recently migrated our production database from MariaDB to PostgreSQL using streaming replication to minimise the potential downtime and have replicated environments to adapt and test our backend APIs properly.</p>\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n<p>We look for someone who has experience with different stacks (mainly Linux based), technologies and production models and has participated actively on the build of essential pieces of a cloud platform.</p>\n<p>Someone that knows how to conduct a technical operation that potentially affects users and at the same time can code small applications and scripts to automate the platform and also debug problems in other people's code.</p>\n<p>You care about security, code quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity.

What‚Äôs more, with over 1.5 million monthly visitors, we‚Äôre at the forefront of providing premier design education to such organizations as IBM and SAP, as well as thousands of other companies. Our ever-growing community now needs a first-class front-end developer to&nbsp;<strong>help craft the ultimate user experience</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is where your&nbsp;<strong>passion for UX and hard-science coding skills</strong>&nbsp;merge: Every time your code is executed,&nbsp;<strong>you help improve the life of a human being</strong>. And not only that, those members will likely go on to design better products and services to the benefit of all humankind.</p>\n<p>Our front-end code is a&nbsp;<strong>vital part of our winning formula</strong>: Our codebase is our baby and it can never become too perfect.

That means that every day, were looking for ways to help you find your purpose, and spend your life in its pursuit and maximisation. We call that the #PursuitOfTheUngooglable. Were less a company than an anarchist commune of highly driven people who have aligned purposes. Together, were looking at radically new ways to create economic value together, in four major patterns consultancy, products, innovation, and doing good.\nWhat was a hypothesis three short years ago is now a consultancy on the AFR Fast 100 @ #86, and #9 on the Deloitte Tech Fast 50 Rising Stars, an interactive arts &amp; games studio written about in PC Powerplay featuring an unprecedented 32 games created in 16 months, an innovation program delivering outcomes to The Centre of Independent Studies, the CSIRO and Hello Sunday Morning (the winner of Googles Impact Challenge) as well as founding, funding and supporting over 4,500 micro-volunteers in six countries to complete nearly 20,000 acts of good via our non-profit, Cause Corps.\nAbout 10% of our profits go directly toward our non-profit partners, including One Child and Cause Corps; and our skilled volunteering opportunities are directed toward the latter.\nAs a consultancy, we provide a special rate card accessible only to non profits, helping everything from Indigenous students get connected to scholarships to teaching kids about recycling and ocean plastic via games.\nWe hire for people who want to learn and grow and #DoTheUngooglable; and we have a deep culture of teaching a rolling stone gathers no moss, looking after each other its okay to not be okay, and customer delight a certain polish.\nyou need.\nA consultancy, a product incubator, an innovation hub that prizes three things: * a system of radical transparency. We talk about the customers we lose openly and the reasons why we lost them so we can talk about how to improve together; we publish our games (failed or successful) online to demonstrate our learning journey; we have an internally transparent salary grading and rate card, allowing everybody to know what everybody else makes for themselves and for the company. We make all this and more visible all the time to allow our people to focus instead on making things (and each other) better.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a place that values drive. On your first day, expect to be handed a blank sheet of paper and asked: what is your purpose in life? Youll be asked to think about it, and declare it openly and hang it on the office wall, alongside those of every other no mosser. Youll spend your career with us in its renewal, pursuit, refinement and sometimes rejection of this declared purpose as you discover something else. Along the way, youll gain mastery of your craft (if you dont already have it); perhaps a mastery of a (few) new crafts; and definitely mastery of teaching others what you know.</li>\n<li>an ecosystem of wholeness. We like you for all of you; not just the work face youve been putting on. We like that you were a childhood piano prodigy, or had a previous career in construction. We respect that you dedicate your spare time to writing science fiction, or what you really care about is surfing with your children. We admire that your purpose is to take people off the streets, to create safe environments for people to grow and excel, or to challenge the notion that work-life balance isnt just life balance. Theres room for diversity of thought at no moss, and were privileged to continually better our ecosystem toward that end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>you like.\nGetting stuff done. A rigorous process that uplifts people and enables them to be the rolling stone that attains a certain polish. You want to add to these organisational learnings and make us better.

You like conversations where we celebrate failing personal, team-based, organisational and subsequent learning.\nyou expect.\nOther people who are purpose driven. People who value psychological safety. A place where people are good at listening and incredible at taking appropriate action. To be free to challenge the status quo and each other to greater things.

People who want to give back to ecosystems that are finding new, more human ways of working.\nwe expect.\nPeople who do what they say and say what theyll do.
