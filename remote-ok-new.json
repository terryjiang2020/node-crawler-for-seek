We have over six million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoweare\">Who We Are</h2>\n<p>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of about forty with fifteen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US. We were recently recognised as one of the <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses\">UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses</a> and as the <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner\">Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education</a> in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ourtech\">Our Tech</h2>\n<p>Overleaf is based on open source software, and most of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf (note: most activity is in the repos linked from there).</p>\n<p>We run a mainly Node.js back end using MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis. We use a microservices architecture, with about a dozen services. On the front end, we mainly use Angular v1 and are incrementally migrating to React.</p>\n<p>We're hosted on Google Cloud Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine. We use Docker to manage our development environments. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwework\">How We Work</h2>\n<p>Overleaf is remote-first --- all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office in Farringdon for those in the London area, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.</p>\n<p>We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which our development teams have 10–15 minute daily standup calls. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within teams.</p>\n<p>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.</p>\n<p>We organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).</p>\n<h2 id=\"aboutthisrole\">About This Role</h2>\n<p>We plan to add two developers to our team, both with a backend focus. Experience with some of Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis or Kubernetes is desirable. We are also particularly interested in meeting you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you'd be interested in taking up a team lead role in the not too distant future, or</li>\n<li>you have experience with setting up data pipelines for web analytics and/or business intelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key projects on our road map this year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve our B2C conversion metrics and monitoring — we'll be setting up a new web analytics system to generate insights we need while continuing to respect user privacy</li>\n<li>Consolidate our two project history systems — we currently have two from our integration with ShareLaTeX in 2017, each with hundreds of TB to be consolidated</li>\n<li>Make our project PDF preview faster and less bandwidth hungry — we have prototypes showing big wins that now need productionizing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-file-outline-is-now-available-on-overleaf</li>\n<li>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/new-feature-transfer-project-ownership-on-overleaf</li>\n<li>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the longer term, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwehire\">How We Hire</h2>\n<p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within 14 days from when we receive it.</p></li>\n<li><p>We'll follow up by email (or sometimes schedule a phone call) with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.</p></li>\n<li><p>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.</p></li>\n<li><p>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>We require that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).</li>\n<li>will work for us full time (or nearly full time).</li>\n<li>will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applicants in the UK, Europe, US and Canada are preferred.</p>\n<p>Experience with the technologies we use is always a plus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote and flexible working.</li>\n<li>Salary £40k–£75k per year depending on experience.</li>\n<li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.</li>\n<li>We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.</li>\n<li>We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures (https://bethnalgreenventures.com/) and Digital Science (https://www.digital-science.com/), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.</li>\n<li>Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.</li>\n<li>We get everyone together in London for team meetings several times a year for valuable face-to-face time (pandemic permitting).</li>\n<li>You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.</li>\n<li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.</li>\n<li>We run quarterly <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleafs-remote-hackathon-revisited-one-year\">remote hackathons</a> to keep learning and experimenting.</li>\n<li>We run a weekly internal seminar series with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

We’ve always believed remote is the future of work, and much like the experimentation we do, have iterated a lot along the way in a persistent effort to get it right.\n*&nbsp;<strong>We’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country. Daytime availability is required for syncing with the team via Slack or Zoom, but Experiment Engineers enjoy all the flexibility remote working has to offer. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through both synchronous and asynchronous communications.\n*&nbsp;<strong>We value elegant code as much as you do, but we move fast.</strong>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs on top of existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). There will be polling patterns and liberal use of !important.\n*&nbsp;<strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension — extremely important. This is not a simple “pull tickets and give sign off” gig. Successful applicants enjoy collaborating across teams, defining and clarifying needs, documenting processes, improving processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</p>\n<p>You can read more about our <a href=\"https://crometrics.com/culture/\">culture and values here</a> or <a href=\"https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/\">learn more about the team</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Stack</strong></p>\n<p>*&nbsp;<strong>Email/Calendar:</strong>&nbsp;GSuite\n*&nbsp;<strong>CRO Platforms:</strong>&nbsp;Optimizely, VWO, Google Optimize, Convert, AB Tasty\n*&nbsp;<strong>IDE:</strong>&nbsp;Your choice.

We use Asana for project management, GitHub for code reviews, and Slack for daily communication. We also have a Rails API and consider it a major bonus if you have experience working on Rails applications.</p>\n<p>Some projects you may work on include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research and implement architectural changes such as migrating our browser extension to Redux.</li>\n<li>Help measure the effectiveness of certain features by building a reusable analytics module to use across our products.</li>\n<li>Improve our brand and usability by reskinning components according to our new design system.</li>\n<li>Make our products more reliable by writing integration tests to cover common user workflows.</li>\n<li>Simplify our API interactions by building a GraphQL layer.</li>\n<li>Level up the team by reviewing code and suggesting improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, you’ll become an owner of some areas of our codebase and have the freedom to improve them as you see fit.</p>\n<p><strong>Who you are</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A builder - Frontend development is full of helpful tools, libraries, and patterns, and you enjoy using these to build products people will love. You like new challenges and strive to ship new features to customers on a regular basis.</li>\n<li>Life long learner - You enjoy keeping up with the latest trends in frontend space. If a project uses a framework that’s new to you, you dive into the docs and tutorials to figure it out.</li>\n<li>Have an owner mentality - When bugs appear, you document and fix them. When projects are too complex, you work with others to refine the scope until it’s something you believe can be built in a reasonable amount of time and maintained in the long run.</li>\n<li>Care about code quality - You believe simple is better and strive to write code that is easy to read and maintain. You consider edge cases and write tests to handle them. When you come across legacy code that is difficult to understand, you add comments or refactor it to make it easier for the next person.</li>\n<li>Balancing Act - Great products must balance performance, customer value, code quality, dependencies, and so on. You know how to consider all of these concerns while keeping your focus on shipping things.</li>\n<li>The great communicator - If a project is off-track, you bring it up proactively and suggest ways to simplify and get things going. You proactively share status updates without being asked and strive to keep things as honest and transparent as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"location\">Location</h1>\n<p>🌏 Worldwide</p>","location":"Worldwide","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/100997","apply_link":"https://remoteok.io/l/100997"},{"slug":"100994-remote-backend-developer-cosuno","id":"100994","epoch":"1608653356","date":"2020-12-22T16:09:16+00:00","company":"Cosuno","company_logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/355654034dbe5329c71abadbcce41d4d1609747223.png","position":"Backend Developer (Berlin, Germany)","tags":["dev","backend","digital nomad"],"logo":"https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/355654034dbe5329c71abadbcce41d4d1609747223.png","description":"<p>What you will be working on</p>\n<p>As a Backend Developer, you will work on&nbsp;our Node-based GraphQL API&nbsp;as well as related services (e.g. database/search) and infrastructure based on AWS.&nbsp;Together with the Full Stack Developers in our team, you will work on our core SaaS product, but your focus will not be&nbsp;the implementation of new features, but rather&nbsp;the improvement of&nbsp;our backend services.

We're looking for a Software Engineer to join our small team to build, own and scale the distribution of Raycast extensions via a store that developers around the world can contribute to.</p>\n<p>Raycast is a native Mac application with a significant focus on top-notch UI and interactions. We genuinely care about user experience, performance, privacy and ease of use. We had enough of dealing with slow and clunky tools. Raycast is our attempt to let you enjoy your daily workflows without all the distractions.</p>\n<p>When Apple announced the App Store in 2008, the distribution of software changed over night. Suddenly, developers could reach millions of customers. We believe it's about time to change how developers discover and consume productivity tools. At the center of this, is a store full of Raycast extensions that people can share and manage or discover new ones from others. We need hungry engineers that architect and build this store to revolutionise how developers experience productivity tools with us.</p>\n<p>We're a fully remote company and looking for candidates in the UTC timezone (London, Lisbon, Dakar, â€¦) ± 3 hours. This position is for a full-time employment.</p>\n<p>In this role you willâ€¦</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Build the infrastructure of our store.&nbsp;You design a stable cloud infrastructure and backend architecture that is open for extension, and an API that other developers love to use. You're implementing the distribution of our extensions and work closely with macOS engineering where needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Co-own the product and work self-directed.&nbsp;We're a small team of individual contributors. Everybody has autonomy and responsibility. You work on features from ideation over release to maintenance and shape the roadmap of the product.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shape the experience for contributors. The store is one piece of the puzzle. You generate ideas about how developers should add and maintain extensions. You optimise for ease-of-use for producers and consumers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Improve performance and care about quality. You dogfood your own features with our nightly builds, respond to user feedback in our community and jump into performance profiling to make API calls fast. You automate tedious tasks. At best, directly in Raycast.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wear many hats. In a small startup, we're all generalists. You might add a new page to our Vue.js website, set up infrastructure components, or write a blog post about a new feature.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be a great fit ifâ€¦</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You know how to build great APIs.&nbsp;Ideally, you've built and scaled APIs before and have a playbook to kickstart development with modern backend languages. You've worked with different types of data stores, and you know best practices around data modeling and access. Moreover, you can reason well about the tradeoffs of different programming languages and tech stacks without being dogmatic, f.e. decide if we should adopt GraphQL or REST.</p></li>\n<li><p>You're highly productive while writing quality code. We release updates every 1-2 weeks. You can break down big projects in small deliverables. You care about the outcome and take a pragmatic approach to deliver it. You keep things simple and rather write more code than adopting a third-party dependency. You know when you want a code review or need to write tests.</p></li>\n<li><p>You're product-minded. You have a sense for great user experience and feel when something is off. You work with continuous deployment and preview environments to get constant feedback and you have monitoring and analytics in place to quickly act when something unexpected happens. You're eager to optimize API responsiveness and dig deep when there is a need to resolve a tricky issue. You treat APIs as products and proactively iterate on them.</p></li>\n<li><p>You put our users first. Throughout Raycast you find many little details. You pay attention to detail and provide our users a delightful experience. You can't stand bugs and don't shy away from user feedback.</p></li>\n<li><p>You're an empathetic communicator. You treat technology as tradeoffs. You may be opinionated but you're not ideological. When disagreeing, you communicate thoughtfully your perspective and compromise when needed. You're thriving in a team environment and hold your colleagues accountable.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Application process</p>\n<p>During our interview process, we want to make sure that both sides get a good understanding of what it feels to work together day-to-day. Our process contains a few steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Send us an engaging email.&nbsp;Tell us why you want to join Raycast and why you generally care about the problem we're solving. Make your first impression count. Share with us what excites you and how you envision your role at Raycast.</p></li>\n<li><p>An intro call with the founders.&nbsp;Both parties get to know each other. You learn more about Raycast and can ask us any question. From our side, we want to understand what motivated you to apply.</p></li>\n<li><p>Work on a real task. We want to demonstrate how it is to collaborate with the team. For this, we give you an assignment that we would actually build and create a shared Slack channel to communicate. We'll compensate you for the task.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another video call to present your task. Time to show your work in a short video call with some of us. Expect some role-specific questions to better understand how you tick.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the last step, we get back to you with a decision.

We believe such a system can raise prosperity for people and companies everywhere.</p>\n<p>Engineering at Circle:</p>\n<p>In 2020, Circle unveiled Circle APIs: a set of solutions and smarter technology to help businesses accept payments in a more global, scalable and efficient alternative to traditional banking rails (spoiler: we’re using USD Coin under the hood).</p>\n<p>Over the next 12 months, we’re going to rapidly grow our API customer base and enable even more businesses to easily integrate and benefit from the breakthrough of programmable money on the internet.</p>\n<p>If you’re data-driven, interested in building something meaningful and would love to work in an entrepreneurial environment, we can’t wait to hear from you.</p>\n<p>You will aspire to our four core values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Multistakeholder - you have dedication and commitment to our customers, shareholders, employees and families and local communities.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mindful - you seek to be respectful, an active listener and to pay attention to detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>\n<li><p>Driven by Excellence - you are driven by our mission and our passion for customer success which means you relentlessly pursue excellence, that you do not tolerate mediocrity and you work intensely to achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p></li>\n<li><p>High Integrity - you seek open and honest communication, and you hold yourself to very high moral and ethical standards.&nbsp; You reject manipulation, dishonesty and intolerance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your team is responsible for:</p>\n<p>Developers love using Circle APIs but our business partners rely on our client tools for their day-to-day insights and health of their billing stack. To that end, you’ll work on providing a seamless onboarding flow to help new business get their payments off the ground. And as a new business launches with Circle APIs, they use Circle’s dashboards (with your help!) to help manage and optimize their payments.

Simply put, our business is growing and we’ve taken our marketing machine as far as it can go given our expertise and time. We’re looking for someone far better than we are to dedicate themselves to improving our marketing.</p>\n<p>Duckbill presents a unique challenge for a product marketer: we operate three distinct lines-of-business with their own customer personas, GTM strategy, and sales approach. Each line of business works together, feeding each other and growing each other. Those lines of business are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.duckbillgroup.com\">Our AWS cost management consulting</a>, which is focused on enterprise B2B.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lastweekinaws.com\">Our media business</a>, which operates multiple media publications and generates its own revenue via sponsorships.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ducktools.com\">DuckTools</a>, our niche SaaS app in the AWS cost optimization space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your work will primarily focus on our consulting and SaaS at first, and we expect you’ll naturally begin splitting time evenly between them after a while.</p>\n<p>You will be our first full-time marketing hire, taking over the duty from one of our founders (the CEO, whom you’ll report to). This gives you the opportunity to shape a marketing function as it grows from its early days. You will be expected to get your hands dirty and execute on the plans you create. Our expectation is that you will figure out new ways for us to grow our audience and better reach our prospective customers, which will naturally lead to a mix of contractors, agencies, and additional staff as we grow.</p>\n<p>While “first marketing hire” causes some to dread the conversations around convincing everyone marketing is important, we’re happy to say you won’t have any of those issues here. We’re all big believers in the value and power of effective marketing here.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be responsible for determining the right marketing activities to do and ensuring their execution. We currently use SEO, email, organic social, and digital events for our growth, but we'd love to hear your ideas.</li>\n<li>Regularly measure progress of our marketing activities and experiments, and make adjustments as needed</li>\n<li>You should have a proven track record in driving growth, revenue, and inbound leads. You will have KPIs you'll be responsible for hitting (audience growth and inbound leads).</li>\n<li>Provide your marketing expertise to the founders as input to our marketing strategy.</li>\n<li>The content side of sales enablement is a big part of this role. You’ll work closely with our sales staff to ensure they have the best collateral for their needs, as well as continually honing our messaging for both the sales team and for our website.</li>\n<li>We use a lot of email marketing in Duckbill in the form of automated funnels and some basic segmentation and personalization. We’re hoping to improve our segmentation and per-segment messaging. You’ll be responsible for this end-to-end.</li>\n<li>Oversee the growth of our Media publications and ensure our total audience reach continues to grow. We’re currently experimenting with organic content, but we’re betting you have other great ideas.</li>\n<li>Manage and direct the various marketing contractors and vendors we rely on. They'll take their direction from you, and you'll be responsible for identifying new contractors/vendors as needed.</li>\n<li>Manage the marketing spend and sticking within our budget.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Some example upcoming projects</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re releasing our first lead magnets along with automated email sequences to accompany them soon. We’d like to do more of these but aren’t sure which opportunities are the best for us.</li>\n<li>We’re beginning to experiment with content creation for SEO and organic traffic. There’s opportunity here for building a team of writers and an expansive content plan.</li>\n<li>We’d like to start some email marketing specifically for our target customer base, perhaps in the form of a monthly email newsletter.</li>\n<li>We’ve learned of the power of webinars as a result of our work for sponsors, but haven’t yet started this ourselves. We’d like to experiment with them.</li>\n<li>Help us build the SaaS GTM plan--from scratch! We’ve got some ideas, you’ve got plenty more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>5+ years of experience in an B2B SaaS startup in a marketing role</li>\n<li>Prior experience managing contractors, vendors, or staff. While you won't have any employees under you, you will be expected to manage and direct any marketing contractors/vendors you bring in.</li>\n<li>Significant experience in inbound, content-oriented marketing using both organic and paid tactics</li>\n<li>Prior experience in an early-stage startup. We’re a small company and you’ll need to be used to working in one and all that entails.</li>\n<li>Prior experience leveraging a founder’s public influence to drive growth. Much of our lead generation is the result of our founders being active in public; you will need to leverage and grow that further, and prior experience doing so is important to us.</li>\n<li>You should be comfortable with writing a lot and reading even more. 90% of team communication within Duckbill is written, whether it’s Slack, a Google Doc, or email. We use long-form writing for communicating ideas and discussing them.</li>\n<li>US-based and legally authorized to work in the United States (sorry, Legal requires it 🙁 )</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nice-to-Haves</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior experience in the AWS cost optimization space. If you have it, awesome. If you don’t, no problem--you’ll learn it with us.</li>\n<li>Prior experience leveraging a founder’s public influence to drive growth. Much of our lead generation is the result of our founders being active in public; you will need to leverage and grow that further, and prior experience doing so is important to us.</li>\n<li>Experience with various marketing tools. We use Pipedrive for CRM, ConvertKit for email, Buffer for social media. Clearly, we have room to expand and you should be familiar with the options and how to evaluate them for our use.</li>\n<li>Prior experience with executives who build software products on AWS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compensation &amp; Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Compensation for this role ranges between $120,000 and $140,000 per year depending on experience; we do not provide equity.</p>\n<p>We provide a 401(k) with a 100% match up to 6% of your salary. The 401(k) vests immediately, too.</p>\n<p>We provide healthcare, vision, and dental with premiums fully covered by the company. Of course trans benefits are covered; trans rights are human rights. Dependents are covered 50%.</p>\n<p>“Unlimited PTO” is often misused to pressure employees into taking less vacation than they should, so we offer 3 weeks of PTO that accrue monthly, plus unlimited sick leave.</p>\n<p>“Paid parental leave” is challenging for a small company. Being a parent is far more challenging, so we of course offer paid parental leave for new parents of any gender.</p>\n<p>We provide an allowance of up to $3,000 for setting up your home office, or we’ll cover the cost of a membership at a coworking space.</p>\n<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\n<p>We look for three things in every candidate: smart, humble, and hungry. That is, we actively seek out people to join us who are emotionally intelligent, desire to build up the team rather than solely themselves, and passionately pursue goals and outcomes.</p>\n<p>We are a fully remote company with team members in San Francisco, Portland, NYC, and more. We’re a small company (you’d be employee #9!) and a young company (our two year anniversary is March 1, 2021).</p>\n<p>We are not venture-funded, and have no intention of becoming so. We’re financed instead by the magic of revenue and profitability. We focus on growing steadily and remaining profitable as we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</strong></p>\n<p>We’re building a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other. We hire adults. We value transparency, autonomy, experimentation, and kind, direct feedback. We welcome nontraditional candidates, and people of all backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives. We’re an equal opportunity employer and our hiring process is structured to put you at ease and help you demonstrate your best work. If we are doing a poor job of this at any time, please let us know. We hire for strengths, not absence of weakness. Come do great things with us.    </p>\n<h1 id=\"salary\">Salary</h1>\n<p>$120,000 — $140,000</p>\n<h1 id=\"location\">Location</h1>\n<p>🇺🇸 US-only</p>","location":"United States","original":true,"url":"https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/100892","apply_link":"https://remoteok.io/l/100892"},{"slug":"100890-remote-senior-full-stack-engineer-docstation","id":"100890","epoch":"1608143400","date":"2020-12-16T18:30:00+00:00","company":"DocStation","company_logo":"","position":"Senior Full Stack Engineer (Austin, TX)","tags":["fullstack","senior","engineer"],"description":"<p><em>Given our work with health plans sponsored by the US government, this posting is for US-based citizens only.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutdocstation\">About DocStation</h3>\n<p>DocStation takes pharmacists from pills to patients.
